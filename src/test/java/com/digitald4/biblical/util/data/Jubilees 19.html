<p>[Chapter 19]
<OL>
  <LI>And in the first year of the first week in the forty-second jubilee, Abraham returned and
    dwelt
    opposite Hebron, that is Kirjath Arba, two weeks of years.  <LI>And in the first year of the
  third week
  of this jubilee the days of the life of Sarah were accomplished, and she died in Hebron.
  <LI>And Abraham went to mourn over her and bury her, and we tried him [to see] if his spirit were
    patient and he were not indignant in the words of his mouth; and he was found patient in this, and
    was not
    disturbed.  <LI>For in patience of spirit he conversed with the children of Heth, to the intent
  that they
  should give him a place in which to bury his dead.  <LI>And the Lord gave him grace before
  all who saw him, and he besought in gentleness the sons of Heth, and they gave him the land of
  the double
  cave over against Mamre, that is Hebron, for four hundred pieces of silver.  <LI>And they
  besought him saying, We shall give it to thee for nothing; but he would not take it from their
  hands for nothing, for he gave the price of the place, the money in full, and he bowed down before
  them twice, and after
  this he buried his dead in the double cave.  <LI>And all the days of the life of Sarah were one
  hundred and twenty-seven years, that is, two jubilees and four weeks and one year:  these are the
  days of the
  years of the life of Sarah.  <LI>This is the tenth trial wherewith Abraham was tried, and he
  was found
  faithful, patient in spirit.  <LI>And he said not a single word regarding the rumour in the land
  how that God had said that He would give it to him and to his seed after him, and he begged a
  place there to bury his dead; for he was found faithful, and was recorded on the heavenly tablets
  as the friend of
  God.  <LI>And in the fourth year thereof he took a wife for his son Isaac and her name was
  Rebecca [2020 A.M.] [the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, the brother of Abraham] the
  sister of Laban and daughter of Bethuel; and Bethuel was the son of Melca, who was the wife of
  Nahor, the brother of Abraham.
  <LI>And Abraham took to himself a third wife, and her name was Keturah, from among the
    daughters of his household servants, for Hagar had died before Sarah.  And she bare him six sons,
    Zimram,
    and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah, in the two weeks of
    years.  <LI>And in
  the sixth week, in the second year thereof, Rebecca bare to Isaac two sons, Jacob and
  Esau, <LI>and [2046 A.M.] Jacob was a smooth and upright man, and Esau was fierce, a man of the
  field, and hairy, and Jacob
  dwelt in tents.  <LI>And the youths grew, and Jacob learned to write; but Esau did not
  learn, for he
  was a man of the field and a hunter, and he learnt war, and all his deeds were fierce.
  <LI>And Abraham
    loved Jacob, but Isaac loved Esau.  <LI>And Abraham saw the deeds of Esau, and he knew
  that in Jacob should his name and seed be called; and he called Rebecca and gave commandment
  regarding
  Jacob, for he knew that she (too) loved Jacob much more than Esau.  <LI>And he said unto
  her:  <P>

    My daughter, watch over my son Jacob, <BR>
    For he shall be in my stead on the earth, <BR>
    And for a blessing in the midst of the children of men, <BR>
    And for the glory of the whole seed of Shem.<P>

  <LI>For I know that the Lord will choose him to be a people for possession unto Himself,
    above all
    peoples that are upon the face of the earth.  <LI>And behold, Isaac my son loves Esau more
  than Jacob, but I see that thou truly lovest Jacob.
  <P>
  <LI>Add still further to thy kindness to him, <BR>
    And let thine eyes be upon him in love; <BR>
    For he shall be a blessing unto us on the earth from henceforth unto all generations of the
    earth.<P>

  <LI>Let thy hands be strong <BR>
    And let thy heart rejoice in thy son Jacob; <BR>
    For I have loved him far beyond all my sons.<P>

      He shall be blessed for ever, <BR>
      And his seed shall fill the whole earth.<P>

  <LI>If a man can number the sand of the earth, <BR>
    His seed also shall be numbered.<P>

  <LI>And all the blessings wherewith the Lord hath blessed me and my seed shall belong to
    Jacob and
    his seed alway.  <LI>And in his seed shall my name be blessed, and the name of my fathers,
  Shem, and
  Noab, and Enoch, and Mahalalel, and Enos, and Seth, and Adam.  <LI>And these shall
  serve <P>

    To lay the foundations of the heaven, <BR>
    And to strengthen the earth, <BR>
    And to renew all the luminaries which are in the firmament.<P>

  <LI>And he called Jacob before the eyes of Rebecca his mother, and kissed him, and blessed
    him, and
    said:  <LI>'Jacob, my beloved son, whom my soul loveth, may God bless thee from above
  the firmament, and may He give thee all the blessings wherewith He blessed Adam, and Enoch,
  and Noah, and Shem; and all the things of which He told me, and all the things which He
  promised to give me, may he cause to cleave to thee and to thy seed for ever, according to the
  days of heaven above the
  earth.  <LI>And the Spirits of Mast&ecirc;m&acirc; shall not rule over thee or over thy seed to turn thee
  from the
  Lord, who is thy God from henceforth for ever.  <LI>And may the Lord God be a father to
  thee and
  thou the first-born son, and to the people alway.  <LI>Go in peace, my son.'  And they both
  went forth
  together from Abraham.  <LI>And Rebecca loved Jacob, with all her heart and with all her
  soul, very much more than Esau; but Isaac loved Esau much more than Jacob.
