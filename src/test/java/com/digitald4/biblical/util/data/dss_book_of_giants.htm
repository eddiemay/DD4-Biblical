          <h2 align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">The Book of Giants</font></h2>
          <p align="center"><strong><font face="Times New Roman">4Q203, 1Q23, 2Q26, 4Q530-532, 6Q8</font></strong></p>
          <h3><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Introduction and Commentary</font></strong></h3>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is fair to say that the patriarch Enoch was as well
            known to the ancients as he is obscure to modern Bible readers. Besides giving his age
            (365 years), the book of Genesis says of him only that he &quot;walked with God,&quot; and
            afterward &quot;he was not, because God had taken him&quot; (Gen. 5:24). This exalted way
            of life and mysterious demise made Enoch into a figure of considerable fascination, and a
            cycle of legends grew up around him. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of the legends about Enoch were collected already in
            ancient times in several long anthologies. The most important such anthology, and the
            oldest, is known simply as The Book of Enoch, comprising over one hundred chapters. It
            still survives in its entirety (although only in the Ethiopic language) and forms an
            important source for the thought of Judaism in the last few centuries B.C.E.
            Significantly, the remnants of several almost complete copies of The Book of Enoch in
            Aramaic were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, and it is clear that whoever collected the
            scrolls considered it a vitally important text. All but one of the five major components
            of the Ethiopic anthology have turned up among the scrolls. But even more intriguing is
            the fact that additional, previously unknown or little-known texts about Enoch were
            discovered at Qumran. The most important of these is The Book of Giants. </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman">Enoch lived before the Flood, during a time when the
            world, in ancient imagination, was very different. Human beings lived much longer, for one
            thing; Enoch's son Methuselah, for instance, attained the age of 969 years. Another
            difference was that angels and humans interacted freely -- so freely, in fact, that some
            of the angels begot children with human females. This fact is neutrally reported in
            Genesis (6:1-4), but other stories view this episode as the source of the corruption that
            made the punishing flood necessary. According to The Book of Enoch, the mingling of angel
            and human was actually the idea of Shernihaza, the leader of the evil angels, who lured
            200 others to cohabit with women. The offspring of these unnatural unions were giants 450
            feet high. The wicked angels and the giants began to oppress the human population and to
            teach them to do evil. For this reason God determined to imprison the angels until the
            final judgment and to destroy the earth with a flood. Enoch's efforts to intercede with
            heaven for the fallen angels were unsuccessful (1 Enoch 6-16). </font></p>
          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>The Book of Giants</em> retells part of this story and
            elaborates on the exploits of the giants, especially the two children of Shemihaza, Ohya
            and Hahya. Since no complete manuscript exists of Giants, its exact contents and their
            order remain a matter of guesswork. Most of the content of the present fragments concerns
            the giants' ominous dreams and Enoch's efforts to interpret them and to intercede with God
            on the giants' behalf. Unfortunately, little remains of the independent adventures of the
            giants, but it is likely that these tales were at least partially derived from ancient
            Near Eastern mythology. Thus the name of one of the giants is Gilgamesh, the Babylonian
            hero and subject of a great epic written in the third millennium B.C.E. </font>
