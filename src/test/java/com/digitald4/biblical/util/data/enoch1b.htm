<h3 align="CENTER">BOOK 1 (Book of Watchers)</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> The words of the blessing of Enoch, wherewith he blessed the elect and righteous,
who will be <b>2</b> living in the day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are
to be removed. And he took up his parable and said -Enoch a righteous man, whose eyes were
opened by God, saw the vision of the Holy One in the heavens, which the angels showed me,
and from them I heard everything, and from them I understood as I saw, but not for this
generation, but for a remote one which is for to come. <b>3 </b>Concerning the elect I
said, and took up my parable concerning them: </p>

<p>The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling, <br>
<b>4</b> And the eternal God will tread upon the earth, (even) on Mount Sinai, <br>
[And appear from His camp] <br>
And appear in the strength of His might from the heaven of heavens.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> And all shall be smitten with fear <br>
And the Watchers shall quake, <br>
And great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And the high mountains shall be shaken, <br>
And the high hills shall be made low, <br>
And shall melt like wax before the flame</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> And the earth shall be wholly rent in sunder, <br>
And all that is upon the earth shall perish, <br>
And there shall be a judgement upon all (men).</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> But with the righteous He will make peace.</p>

<p>And will protect the elect, <br>
And mercy shall be upon them.</p>

<p>And they shall all belong to God, <br>
And they shall be prospered, <br>
And they shall all be blessed.</p>

<p>And He will help them all, <br>
And light shall appear unto them, <br>
And He will make peace with them'.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> And behold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones <br>
To execute judgement upon all, <br>
And to destroy all the ungodly:</p>

<p>And to convict all flesh <br>
Of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed, <br>
And of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him. </p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Observe ye everything that takes place in the heaven, how they do not change
their orbits, and the luminaries which are in the heaven, how they all rise and set in
order each in its season, and <b>2</b> transgress not against their appointed order.
Behold ye the earth, and give heed to the things which take place upon it from first to
last, how steadfast they are, how none of the things upon earth <b>3</b> change, but all
the works of God appear to you. Behold the summer and the winter, how the whole earth is
filled with water, and clouds and dew and rain lie upon it.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Observe and see how (in the winter) all the trees seem as though they had
withered and shed all their leaves, except fourteen trees, which do not lose their foliage
but retain the old foliage from two to three years till the new comes.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And again, observe ye the days of summer how the sun is above the earth over
against it. And you seek shade and shelter by reason of the heat of the sun, and the earth
also burns with growing heat, and so you cannot tread on the earth, or on a rock by reason
of its heat.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Observe ye how the trees cover themselves with green leaves and bear fruit:
wherefore give ye heed and know with regard to all His works, and recognize how He that
liveth for ever hath made them so. <b>2</b> and all His works go on thus from year to year
for ever, and all the tasks which they accomplish for Him, and their tasks change not, but
according as God hath ordained so is it done. <b>3</b> And behold how the sea and the
rivers in like manner accomplish and change not their tasks from His commandments'.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> But ye -ye have not been steadfast, nor done the commandments of the Lord, <br>
But ye have turned away and spoken proud and hard words <br>
With your impure mouths against His greatness. <br>
Oh, ye hard-hearted, ye shall find no peace.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> Therefore shall ye execrate your days, <br>
And the years of your life shall perish, <br>
And the years of your destruction shall be multiplied in eternal execration, <br>
And ye shall find no mercy.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6a</b> In those days ye shall make your names an eternal execration unto all the
righteous, <br>
<b>b</b> And by you shall all who curse, curse, <br>
And all the sinners and godless shall imprecate by you, <br>
<b>7c</b> And for you the godless there shall be a curse.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6d</b> And all the . . . shall rejoice, <br>
<b>e</b> And there shall be forgiveness of sins, <br>
<b>f</b> And every mercy and peace and forbearance: <br>
<b>g</b> There shall be salvation unto them, a goodly light.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>I</b> And for all of you sinners there shall be no salvation, <br>
<b>j</b> But on you all shall abide a curse. <br>
<b>7a</b> But for the elect there shall be light and joy and peace, <br>
<b>b</b> And they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> And then there shall be bestowed upon the elect wisdom, <br>
And they shall all live and never again sin, <br>
Either through ungodliness or through pride: <br>
But they who are wise shall be humble.</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> And they shall not again transgress, <br>
Nor shall they sin all the days of their life, <br>
Nor shall they die of (the divine) anger or wrath, <br>
But they shall complete the number of the days of their life.</p>

<p>And their lives shall be increased in peace, <br>
And the years of their joy shall be multiplied, <br>
In eternal gladness and peace, <br>
All the days of their life.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days
were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. <b>2</b> And the angels, the children
of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us
wives from among the children of men <b>3</b> and beget us children.' And Semjaza, who was
their leader, said unto them: 'I fear ye will not <b>4</b> indeed agree to do this deed,
and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.' And they all answered him and
said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations <b>5</b>
not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.' Then sware they all together and bound
themselves <b>6</b> by mutual imprecations upon it. And they were in all two hundred; who
descended in the days of Jared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount
Hermon, because they had sworn <b>7</b> and bound themselves by mutual imprecations upon
it. And these are the names of their leaders: Samlazaz, their leader, Araklba, Rameel,
Kokablel, Tamlel, Ramlel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, <b>8</b> Asael, Armaros, Batarel,
Ananel, Zaq1el, Samsapeel, Satarel, Turel, Jomjael, Sariel. These are their chiefs of
tens.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives, and each chose
for himself one, and they began to go in unto them and to defile themselves with them, and
they taught them charms <b>2</b> and enchantments, and the cutting of roots, and made them
acquainted with plants. And they <b>3</b> became pregnant, and they bare great giants,
whose height was three thousand ells: Who consumed <b>4</b> all the acquisitions of men.
And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against <b>5</b> them and
devoured mankind. And they began to sin against birds, and beasts, and reptiles, and <b>6</b>
fish, and to devour one another's flesh, and drink the blood. Then the earth laid
accusation against the lawless ones.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And Azazel taught men to make swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates, and
made known to them the metals of the earth and the art of working them, and bracelets, and
ornaments, and the use of antimony, and the beautifying of the eyelids, and all kinds of
costly stones, and all 2 colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they
committed fornication, and they 3 were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways.
Semjaza taught enchantments, and root-cuttings, 'Armaros the resolving of enchantments,
Baraqijal (taught) astrology, Kokabel the constellations, Ezeqeel the knowledge of the
clouds, Araqiel the signs of the earth, Shamsiel the signs of the sun, and Sariel the
course of the moon. And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven . . .</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And then Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw much
blood being 2 shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth. And
they said one to another: 'The earth made without inhabitant cries the voice of their
cryingst up to the gates of heaven. 3 And now to you, the holy ones of heaven, the souls
of men make their suit, saying, "Bring our cause 4 before the Most High."' And
they said to the Lord of the ages: 'Lord of lords, God of gods, King of kings, and God of
the ages, the throne of Thy glory (standeth) unto all the generations of the 5 ages, and
Thy name holy and glorious and blessed unto all the ages! Thou hast made all things, and
power over all things hast Thou: and all things are naked and open in Thy sight, and Thou
seest all 6 things, and nothing can hide itself from Thee. Thou seest what Azazel hath
done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which
were (preserved) in heaven, which 7 men were striving to learn: And Semjaza, to whom Thou
hast given authority to bear rule over his associates. And they have gone to the daughters
of men upon the earth, and have slept with the 9 women, and have defiled themselves, and
revealed to them all kinds of sins. And the women have 10 borne giants, and the whole
earth has thereby been filled with blood and unrighteousness. And now, behold, the souls
of those who have died are crying and making their suit to the gates of heaven, and their
lamentations have ascended: and cannot cease because of the lawless deeds which are 11
wrought on the earth. And Thou knowest all things before they come to pass, and Thou seest
these things and Thou dost suffer them, and Thou dost not say to us what we are to do to
them in regard to these.'</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 10</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Then said the Most High, the Holy and Great One spake, and sent Uriel to the son
of Lamech, <b>2</b> and said to him: Go to Noah and tell him in my name "Hide
thyself!" and reveal to him the end that is approaching: that the whole earth will be
destroyed, and a deluge is about to come <b>3</b> upon the whole earth, and will destroy
all that is on it. And now instruct him that he may escape <b>4</b> and his seed may be
preserved for all the generations of the world. And again the Lord said to Raphael: Bind
Azazel hand and foot, and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening <b>5</b> in the
desert, which is in Dudael, and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged
rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there for ever, and cover his face
that he may <b>6</b>,<b>7</b> not see light. And on the day of the great judgement he
shall be cast into the fire. And heal the earth which the angels have corrupted, and
proclaim the healing of the earth, that they may heal the plague, and that all the
children of men may not perish through all the secret things that the <b>8</b> Watchers
have disclosed and have taught their sons. And the whole earth has been corrupted <b>9</b>
through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin. And to Gabriel said
the Lord: Proceed against the bastards and the reprobates, and against the children of
fornication: and destroy [the children of fornication and] the children of the Watchers
from amongst men [and cause them to go forth]: send them one against the other that they
may destroy each other in <b>10</b> battle: for length of days shall they not have. And no
request that they (i.e. their fathers) make of thee shall be granted unto their fathers on
their behalf; for they hope to live an eternal life, and <b>11</b> that each one of them
will live five hundred years. And the Lord said unto Michael: Go, bind Semjaza and his
associates who have united themselves with women so as to have defiled themselves <b>12</b>
with them in all their uncleanness. And when their sons have slain one another, and they
have seen the destruction of their beloved ones, bind them fast for seventy generations in
the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till
the judgement that is <b>13</b> for ever and ever is consummated. In those days they shall
be led off to the abyss of fire: and 14 to the torment and the prison in which they shall
be confined for ever. And whosoever shall be condemned and destroyed will from thenceforth
be bound together with them to the end of all 15 generations. And destroy all the spirits
of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because 16 they have wronged mankind.
Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil work come to an end: and
let the plant of righteousness and truth appear: and it shall prove a blessing; the works
of righteousness and truth shall be planted in truth and joy for evermore.</p>

<p>17 And then shall all the righteous escape, <br>
And shall live till they beget thousands of children, <br>
And all the days of their youth and their old age <br>
Shall they complete in peace.</p>

<p>18 And then shall the whole earth be tilled in righteousness, and shall all be planted
with trees and 19 be full of blessing. And all desirable trees shall be planted on it, and
they shall plant vines on it: and the vine which they plant thereon shall yield wine in
abundance, and as for all the seed which is sown thereon each measure (of it) shall bear a
thousand, and each measure of olives shall yield 20 ten presses of oil. And cleanse thou
the earth from all oppression, and from all unrighteousness, and from all sin, and from
all godlessness: and all the uncleanness that is wrought upon the earth 21 destroy from
off the earth. And all the children of men shall become righteous, and all nations 22
shall offer adoration and shall praise Me, and all shall worship Me. And the earth shall
be cleansed from all defilement, and from all sin, and from all punishment, and from all
torment, and I will never again send (them) upon it from generation to generation and for
ever.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 11</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And in those days I will open the store chambers of blessing which are in the heaven,
so as to send 2 them down upon the earth over the work and labour of the children of men.
And truth and peace shall be associated together throughout all the days of the world and
throughout all the generations of men.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 12</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Before these things Enoch was hidden, and no one of the children of men knew
where he was <b>2</b> hidden, and where he abode, and what had become of him. And his
activities had to do with the Watchers, and his days were with the holy ones. <b>3</b> And
I Enoch was blessing the Lord of majesty and the King of the ages, and lo! the Watchers <b>4</b>
called me -Enoch the scribe- and said to me: 'Enoch, thou scribe of righteousness, go,
declare to the Watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven, the holy eternal
place, and have defiled themselves with women, and have done as the children of earth do,
and have taken unto themselves <b>5</b> wives: "Ye have wrought great destruction on
the earth: And ye shall have no peace nor forgiveness <b>6</b> of sin: and inasmuch as
they delight themselves in their children, The murder of their beloved ones shall they
see, and over the destruction of their children shall they lament, and shall make
supplication unto eternity, but mercy and peace shall ye not attain."</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 13</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And Enoch went and said: Azazel, thou shalt have no peace: a severe sentence has gone
forth 2 against thee to put thee in bonds: And thou shalt not have toleration nor request
granted to thee, because of the unrighteousness which thou hast taught, and because of all
the works of godlessness 3 and unrighteousness and sin which thou hast shown to men. Then
I went and spoke to them all 4 together, and they were all afraid, and fear and trembling
seized them. And they besought me to draw up a petition for them that they might find
forgiveness, and to read their petition in the presence 5 of the Lord of heaven. For from
thenceforward they could not speak (with Him) nor lift up their 6 eyes to heaven for shame
of their sins for which they had been condemned. Then I wrote out their petition, and the
prayer in regard to their spirits and their deeds individually and in regard to their 7
requests that they should have forgiveness and length. And I went off and sat down at the
waters of Dan, in the land of Dan, to the south of the west of Hermon: I read their
petition till I fell 8 asleep. And behold a dream came to me, and visions fell down upon
me, and I saw visions of chastisement, and a voice came bidding (me) I to tell it to the
sons of heaven, and reprimand them. 9 And when I awaked, I came unto them, and they were
all sitting gathered together, weeping in 10 Abelsjail, which is between Lebanon and
Seneser, with their faces covered. And I recounted before them all the visions which I had
seen in sleep, and I began to speak the words of righteousness, and to reprimand the
heavenly Watchers.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 14</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 The book of the words of righteousness, and of the reprimand of the eternal Watchers
in accordance 2 with the command of the Holy Great One in that vision. I saw in my sleep
what I will now say with a tongue of flesh and with the breath of my mouth: which the
Great One has given to men to 3 converse therewith and understand with the heart. As He
has created and given to man the power of understanding the word of wisdom, so hath He
created me also and given me the power of reprimanding 4 the Watchers, the children of
heaven. I wrote out your petition, and in my vision it appeared thus, that your petition
will not be granted unto you throughout all the days of eternity, and that judgement 5 has
been finally passed upon you: yea (your petition) will not be granted unto you. And from
henceforth you shall not ascend into heaven unto all eternity, and in bonds of the earth
the decree 6 has gone forth to bind you for all the days of the world. And (that)
previously you shall have seen the destruction of your beloved sons and ye shall have no
pleasure in them, but they shall fall before 7 you by the sword. And your petition on
their behalf shall not be granted, nor yet on your own: even though you weep and pray and
speak all the words contained in the writing which I have 8 written. And the vision was
shown to me thus: Behold, in the vision clouds invited me and a mist summoned me, and the
course of the stars and the lightnings sped and hastened me, and the winds in 9 the vision
caused me to fly and lifted me upward, and bore me into heaven. And I went in till I drew
nigh to a wall which is built of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire: and it began
to affright 10 me. And I went into the tongues of fire and drew nigh to a large house
which was built of crystals: and the walls of the house were like a tesselated floor
(made) of crystals, and its groundwork was 11 of crystal. Its ceiling was like the path of
the stars and the lightnings, and between them were 12 fiery cherubim, and their heaven
was (clear as) water. A flaming fire surrounded the walls, and its 13 portals blazed with
fire. And I entered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as ice: there 14 were
no delights of life therein: fear covered me, and trembling got hold upon me. And as I
quaked 15 and trembled, I fell upon my face. And I beheld a vision, And lo! there was a
second house, greater 16 than the former, and the entire portal stood open before me, and
it was built of flames of fire. And in every respect it so excelled in splendour and
magnificence and extent that I cannot describe to 17 you its splendour and its extent. And
its floor was of fire, and above it were lightnings and the path 18 of the stars, and its
ceiling also was flaming fire. And I looked and saw therein a lofty throne: its appearance
was as crystal, and the wheels thereof as the shining sun, and there was the vision of 19
cherubim. And from underneath the throne came streams of flaming fire so that I could not
look 20 thereon. And the Great Glory sat thereon, and His raiment shone more brightly than
the sun and 21 was whiter than any snow. None of the angels could enter and could behold
His face by reason 22 of the magnificence and glory and no flesh could behold Him. The
flaming fire was round about Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none around could
draw nigh Him: ten thousand times 23 ten thousand (stood) before Him, yet He needed no
counselor. And the most holy ones who were 24 nigh to Him did not leave by night nor
depart from Him. And until then I had been prostrate on my face, trembling: and the Lord
called me with His own mouth, and said to me: ' Come hither, 25 Enoch, and hear my word.'
And one of the holy ones came to me and waked me, and He made me rise up and approach the
door: and I bowed my face downwards.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 15</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And He answered and said to me, and I heard His voice: 'Fear not, Enoch, thou
righteous 2 man and scribe of righteousness: approach hither and hear my voice. And go,
say to the Watchers of heaven, who have sent thee to intercede for them: "You should
intercede" for men, and not men 3 for you: Wherefore have ye left the high, holy, and
eternal heaven, and lain with women, and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men and
taken to yourselves wives, and done like the children 4 of earth, and begotten giants (as
your) sons? And though ye were holy, spiritual, living the eternal life, you have defiled
yourselves with the blood of women, and have begotten (children) with the blood of flesh,
and, as the children of men, have lusted after flesh and blood as those also do who die 5
and perish. Therefore have I given them wives also that they might impregnate them, and
beget 6 children by them, that thus nothing might be wanting to them on earth. But you
were formerly 7 spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations of
the world. And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for the spiritual ones
of the heaven, in heaven is their dwelling. 8 And now, the giants, who are produced from
the spirits and flesh, shall be called evil spirits upon 9 the earth, and on the earth
shall be their dwelling. Evil spirits have proceeded from their bodies; because they are
born from men and from the holy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin; 10 they
shall be evil spirits on earth, and evil spirits shall they be called. [As for the spirits
of heaven, in heaven shall be their dwelling, but as for the spirits of the earth which
were born upon the earth, on the earth shall be their dwelling.] And the spirits of the
giants afflict, oppress, destroy, attack, do battle, and work destruction on the earth,
and cause trouble: they take no food, but nevertheless 12 hunger and thirst, and cause
offences. And these spirits shall rise up against the children of men and against the
women, because they have proceeded from them.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 From the days of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants, from the
souls of whose flesh the spirits, having gone forth, shall destroy without incurring
judgement -thus shall they destroy until the day of the consummation, the great judgement
in which the age shall be 2 consummated, over the Watchers and the godless, yea, shall be
wholly consummated." And now as to the watchers who have sent thee to intercede for
them, who had been aforetime in heaven, (say 3 to them): "You have been in heaven,
but all the mysteries had not yet been revealed to you, and you knew worthless ones, and
these in the hardness of your hearts you have made known to the women, and through these
mysteries women and men work much evil on earth." 4 Say to them therefore: " You
have no peace."'</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 17</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And they took and brought me to a place in which those who were there were like
flaming fire, 2 and, when they wished, they appeared as men. And they brought me to the
place of darkness, and to a mountain the point of whose summit reached to heaven. And I
saw the places of the luminaries and the treasuries of the stars and of the thunder and in
the uttermost depths, where were 4 a fiery bow and arrows and their quiver, and a fiery
sword and all the lightnings. And they took 5 me to the living waters, and to the fire of
the west, which receives every setting of the sun. And I came to a river of fire in which
the fire flows like water and discharges itself into the great sea towards 6 the west. I
saw the great rivers and came to the great river and to the great darkness, and went 7 to
the place where no flesh walks. I saw the mountains of the darkness of winter and the
place 8 whence all the waters of the deep flow. I saw the mouths of all the rivers of the
earth and the mouth of the deep.</p>

<h3>Chapter 18</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 I saw the treasuries of all the winds: I saw how He had furnished with them the whole
creation 2 and the firm foundations of the earth. And I saw the corner-stone of the earth:
I saw the four 3 winds which bear [the earth and] the firmament of the heaven. And I saw
how the winds stretch out the vaults of heaven, and have their station between heaven and
earth: these are the pillars 4 of the heaven. I saw the winds of heaven which turn and
bring the circumference of the sun and 5 all the stars to their setting. I saw the winds
on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw the paths 6 of the angels. I saw at the end of the
earth the firmament of the heaven above. And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day
and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, 7 three towards the
east, and three towards the south. And as for those towards the east, was of coloured
stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone. 8
But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit
of the 9,10 throne was of sapphire. And I saw a flaming fire. And beyond these mountains
Is a region the end of the great earth: there the heavens were completed. And I saw a deep
abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of fire fall, which
were beyond measure alike towards 12 the height and towards the depth. And beyond that
abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no firmly founded
earth beneath it: there was no water upon it, and no 13 birds, but it was a waste and
horrible place. I saw there seven stars like great burning mountains, 14 and to me, when I
inquired regarding them, The angel said: 'This place is the end of heaven and earth: this
has become a prison for the stars and the host of heaven. And the stars which roll over
the fire are they which have transgressed the commandment of the Lord in the beginning of
16 their rising, because they did not come forth at their appointed times. And He was
wroth with them, and bound them till the time when their guilt should be consummated
(even) for ten thousand years.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 19</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And Uriel said to me: 'Here shall stand the angels who have connected themselves with
women, and their spirits assuming many different forms are defiling mankind and shall lead
them astray into sacrificing to demons as gods, (here shall they stand,) till the day of
the great judgement in 2 which they shall be judged till they are made an end of. And the
women also of the angels who 3 went astray shall become sirens.' And I, Enoch, alone saw
the vision, the ends of all things: and no man shall see as I have seen.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 20</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1,2 And these are the names of the holy angels who watch. Uriel, one of the holy
angels, who is 3 over the world and over Tartarus. Raphael, one of the holy angels, who is
over the spirits of men. 4,5 Raguel, one of the holy angels who takes vengeance on the
world of the luminaries. Michael, one 6 of the holy angels, to wit, he that is set over
the best part of mankind and over chaos. Saraqael, 7 one of the holy angels, who is set
over the spirits, who sin in the spirit. Gabriel, one of the holy 8 angels, who is over
Paradise and the serpents and the Cherubim. Remiel, one of the holy angels, whom God set
over those who rise.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 21</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1,2 And I proceeded to where things were chaotic. And I saw there something horrible: I
saw neither 3 a heaven above nor a firmly founded earth, but a place chaotic and horrible.
And there I saw 4 seven stars of the heaven bound together in it, like great mountains and
burning with fire. Then 5 I said: 'For what sin are they bound, and on what account have
they been cast in hither?' Then said Uriel, one of the holy angels, who was with me, and
was chief over them, and said: 'Enoch, why 6 dost thou ask, and why art thou eager for the
truth? These are of the number of the stars of heaven, which have transgressed the
commandment of the Lord, and are bound here till ten thousand years, 7 the time entailed
by their sins, are consummated.' And from thence I went to another place, which was still
more horrible than the former, and I saw a horrible thing: a great fire there which burnt
and blazed, and the place was cleft as far as the abyss, being full of great descending
columns of 8 fire: neither its extent or magnitude could I see, nor could I conjecture.
Then I said: 'How 9 fearful is the place and how terrible to look upon!' Then Uriel
answered me, one of the holy angels who was with me, and said unto me: 'Enoch, why hast
thou such fear and affright?' And 10 I answered: 'Because of this fearful place, and
because of the spectacle of the pain.' And he said unto me: 'This place is the prison of
the angels, and here they will be imprisoned for ever.'</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 22</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And thence I went to another place, and he mountain [and] of hard rock. 2 And there
was in it four hollow places, deep and wide and very smooth. How smooth are the hollow
places and deep and dark to look at. 3 Then Raphael answered, one of the holy angels who
was with me, and said unto me: 'These hollow places have been created for this very
purpose, that the spirits of the souls of the dead should 4 assemble therein, yea that all
the souls of the children of men should assemble here. And these places have been made to
receive them till the day of their judgement and till their appointed period [till the
period appointed], till the great judgement (comes) upon them.' I saw (the spirit of) a
dead man making suit, 5 and his voice went forth to heaven and made suit. And I asked
Raphael the angel who was 6 with me, and I said unto him: 'This spirit which maketh suit,
whose is it, whose voice goeth forth and maketh suit to heaven ?' 7 And he answered me
saying: 'This is the spirit which went forth from Abel, whom his brother Cain slew, and he
makes his suit against him till his seed is destroyed from the face of the earth, and his
seed is annihilated from amongst the seed of men.' 8 The I asked regarding it, and
regarding all the hollow places: 'Why is one separated from the other?' 9 And he answered
me and said unto me: 'These three have been made that the spirits of the dead might be
separated. And such a division has been make (for) the spirits of the righteous, in which
there is the bright spring of 10 water. And such has been made for sinners when they die
and are buried in the earth and judgement has not been executed on them in their 11
lifetime. Here their spirits shall be set apart in this great pain till the great day of
judgement and punishment and torment of those who curse for ever and retribution for their
spirits. There 12 He shall bind them for ever. And such a division has been made for the
spirits of those who make their suit, who make disclosures concerning their destruction,
when they were slain in the days 13 of the sinners. Such has been made for the spirits of
men who were not righteous but sinners, who were complete in transgression, and of the
transgressors they shall be companions: but their spirits shall not be slain in the day of
judgement nor shall they be raised from thence.' 14 The I blessed the Lord of glory and
said: 'Blessed be my Lord, the Lord of righteousness, who ruleth for ever.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 23</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1,2 From thence I went to another place to the west of the ends of the earth. And I saw
a burning 3 fire which ran without resting, and paused not from its course day or night
but (ran) regularly. And 4 I asked saying: 'What is this which rests not?' Then Raguel,
one of the holy angels who was with me, answered me and said unto me: 'This course of fire
which thou hast seen is the fire in the west which persecutes all the luminaries of
heaven.'</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 24</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And from thence I went to another place of the earth, and he showed me a mountain
range of 2 fire which burnt day and night. And I went beyond it and saw seven magnificent
mountains all differing each from the other, and the stones (thereof) were magnificent and
beautiful, magnificent as a whole, of glorious appearance and fair exterior: three towards
the east, one founded on the other, and three towards the south, one upon the other, and
deep rough ravines, no one of which 3 joined with any other. And the seventh mountain was
in the midst of these, and it excelled them 4 in height, resembling the seat of a throne:
and fragrant trees encircled the throne. And amongst them was a tree such as I had never
yet smelt, neither was any amongst them nor were others like it: it had a fragrance beyond
all fragrance, and its leaves and blooms and wood wither not for ever: 5 and its fruit is
beautiful, and its fruit n resembles the dates of a palm. Then I said: 'How beautiful is
this tree, and fragrant, and its leaves are fair, and its blooms very delightful in
appearance.' 6 Then answered Michael, one of the holy and honoured angels who was with me,
and was their leader.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 25</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And he said unto me: 'Enoch, why dost thou ask me regarding the fragrance of the
tree, 2 and why dost thou wish to learn the truth?' Then I answered him saying: 'I wish to
3 know about everything, but especially about this tree.' And he answered saying: 'This
high mountain which thou hast seen, whose summit is like the throne of God, is His throne,
where the Holy Great One, the Lord of Glory, the Eternal King, will sit, when He shall
come down to visit 4 the earth with goodness. And as for this fragrant tree no mortal is
permitted to touch it till the great judgement, when He shall take vengeance on all and
bring (everything) to its consummation 5 for ever. It shall then be given to the righteous
and holy. Its fruit shall be for food to the elect: it shall be transplanted to the holy
place, to the temple of the Lord, the Eternal King.</p>

<p>6 Then shall they rejoice with joy and be glad, <br>
And into the holy place shall they enter; <br>
And its fragrance shall be in their bones, <br>
And they shall live a long life on earth, <br>
Such as thy fathers lived:</p>

<p>And in their days shall no sorrow or plague <br>
Or torment or calamity touch them.'</p>

<p>7 Then blessed I the God of Glory, the Eternal King, who hath prepared such things for
the righteous, and hath created them and promised to give to them.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 26</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And I went from thence to the middle of the earth, and I saw a blessed place in which
there were 2 trees with branches abiding and blooming [of a dismembered tree]. And there I
saw a holy mountain, 3 and underneath the mountain to the east there was a stream and it
flowed towards the south. And I saw towards the east another mountain higher than this,
and between them a deep and narrow 4 ravine: in it also ran a stream underneath the
mountain. And to the west thereof there was another mountain, lower than the former and of
small elevation, and a ravine deep and dry between them: and another deep and dry ravine
was at the extremities of the three mountains. And all the ravines were deep rand narrow,
(being formed) of hard rock, and trees were not planted upon 6 them. And I marveled at the
rocks, and I marveled at the ravine, yea, I marveled very much.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 27</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 Then said I: 'For what object is this blessed land, which is entirely filled with
trees, and this 2 accursed valley between?' Then Uriel, one of the holy angels who was
with me, answered and said: 'This accursed valley is for those who are accursed for ever:
Here shall all the accursed be gathered together who utter with their lips against the
Lord unseemly words and of His glory speak hard things. Here shall they be gathered
together, and here 3 shall be their place of judgement. In the last days there shall be
upon them the spectacle of righteous judgement in the presence of the righteous for ever:
here shall the merciful bless the Lord of glory, the Eternal King. 4 In the days of
judgement over the former, they shall bless Him for the mercy in accordance with 5 which
He has assigned them (their lot).' Then I blessed the Lord of Glory and set forth His
glory and lauded Him gloriously.</p>

<h3>Chapter 28</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And thence I went towards the east, into the midst of the mountain range of the
desert, and 2 I saw a wilderness and it was solitary, full of trees and plants. And water
gushed forth from 3 above. Rushing like a copious watercourse [which flowed] towards the
north-west it caused clouds and dew to ascend on every side.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 29</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And thence I went to another place in the desert, and approached to the east of this
mountain 2 range. And there I saw aromatic trees exhaling the fragrance of frankincense
and myrrh, and the trees also were similar to the almond tree.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 30</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1,2 And beyond these, I went afar to the east, and I saw another place, a valley (full)
of water. And 3 therein there was a tree, the colour (?) of fragrant trees such as the
mastic. And on the sides of those valleys I saw fragrant cinnamon. And beyond these I
proceeded to the east.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 31</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And I saw other mountains, and amongst them were groves of trees, and there flowed
forth from 2 them nectar, which is named sarara and galbanum. And beyond these mountains I
saw another mountain to the east of the ends of the earth, whereon were aloe-trees, and
all the trees were full 3 of stacte, being like almond-trees. And when one burnt it, it
smelt sweeter than any fragrant odour.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 32</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And after these fragrant odours, as I looked towards the north over the mountains I
saw seven mountains full of choice nard and fragrant trees and cinnamon and pepper. 2 And
thence I went over the summits of all these mountains, far towards the east of the earth,
and passed above the Erythraean sea and went far from it, and passed over the angel
Zotiel. And I came to the Garden of Righteousness, 3 I and from afar off trees more
numerous than I these trees and great-two trees there, very great, beautiful, and
glorious, and magnificent, and the tree of knowledge, whose holy fruit they eat and know
great wisdom. 4 That tree is in height like the fir, and its leaves are like (those of)
the Carob tree: and its fruit 5 is like the clusters of the vine, very beautiful: and the
fragrance of the tree penetrates afar. Then 6 I said: 'How beautiful is the tree, and how
attractive is its look!' Then Raphael the holy angel, who was with me, answered me and
said: 'This is the tree of wisdom, of which thy father old (in years) and thy aged mother,
who were before thee, have eaten, and they learnt wisdom and their eyes were opened, and
they knew that they were naked and they were driven out of the garden.'</p>

<h3>Chapter 33</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And from thence I went to the ends of the earth and saw there great beasts, and
each differed from the other; and (I saw) birds also differing in appearance and beauty
and voice, the one differing from the other. And to the east of those beasts I saw the
ends of the earth whereon the heaven <b>2</b> rests, and the portals of the heaven open.
And I saw how the stars of heaven come forth, and <b>3</b> I counted the portals out of
which they proceed, and wrote down all their outlets, of each individual star by itself,
according to their number and their names, their courses and their positions, and their <b>4</b>
times and their months, as Uriel the holy angel who was with me showed me. He showed all
things to me and wrote them down for me: also their names he wrote for me, and their laws
and their companies.</p>

<h3>Chapter 34</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And from thence I went towards the north to the ends of the earth, and there I
saw a great and <b>2</b> glorious device at the ends of the whole earth. And here I saw
three portals of heaven open in the heaven: through each of them proceed north winds: when
they blow there is cold, hail, frost, <b>3</b> snow, dew, and rain. And out of one portal
they blow for good: but when they blow through the other two portals, it is with violence
and affliction on the earth, and they blow with violence.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 35</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And from thence I went towards the west to the ends of the earth, and saw there

<h3>Chapter 36</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And from thence I went to the south to the ends of the earth, and saw there three
open portals <b>2</b> of the heaven: and thence there come dew, rain, and wind. And from
thence I went to the east to the ends of the heaven, and saw here the three eastern
portals of heaven open and small portals <b>3</b> above them. Through each of these small
portals pass the stars of heaven and run their course to the west on the path which is
shown to them. And as often as I saw I blessed always the Lord of Glory, and I continued
to bless the Lord of Glory who has wrought great and glorious wonders, to show the
greatness of His work to the angels and to spirits and to men, that they might praise His
work and all His creation: that they might see the work of His might and praise the great
work of His hands and bless Him for ever.</p>

<h3>Chapter 37</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> The second vision which he saw, the vision of wisdom -which Enoch the son of
Jared, the son <b>2</b> of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth,
the son of Adam, saw. And this is the beginning of the words of wisdom which I lifted up
my voice to speak and say to those which dwell on earth: Hear, ye men of old time, and
see, ye that come after, the words of the Holy <b>3</b> One which I will speak before the
Lord of Spirits. It were better to declare (them only) to the men of old time, but even
from those that come after we will not withhold the beginning of wisdom. <b>4</b> Till the
present day such wisdom has never been given by the Lord of Spirits as I have received
according to my insight, according to the good pleasure of the Lord of Spirits by whom the
lot of <b>5</b> eternal life has been given to me. Now three Parables were imparted to me,
and I lifted up my voice and recounted them to those that dwell on the earth. </p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 38</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> The first Parable. </p>

<p>When the congregation of the righteous shall appear,<br>
And sinners shall be judged for their sins,<br>
And shall be driven from the face of the earth: </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> And when the Righteous One shall appear before the eyes of the righteous,<br>
Whose elect works hang upon the Lord of Spirits,<br>
And light shall appear to the righteous and the elect who dwell on the earth, </p>

<p>Where then will be the dwelling of the sinners, </p>

<p>And where the resting-place of those who have denied the Lord of Spirits?<br>
It had been good for them if they had not been born. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> When the secrets of the righteous shall be revealed and the sinners judged,<br>
And the godless driven from the presence of the righteous and elect,<br>
<b>4</b> From that time those that possess the earth shall no longer be powerful and
exalted:<br>
And they shall not be able to behold the face of the holy,<br>
For the Lord of Spirits has caused His light to appear<br>
On the face of the holy, righteous, and elect. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> Then shall the kings and the mighty perish<br>
And be given into the hands of the righteous and holy.<br>
<b>6</b> And thenceforward none shall seek for themselves mercy from the Lord of Spirits<br>
For their life is at an end. </p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 39</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1 And it shall come to pass in those days that elect and holy children will descend
from the <b>2</b> high heaven, and their seed will become one with the children of men.
And in those days Enoch received books of zeal and wrath, and books of disquiet and
expulsion. </p>

<p>And mercy shall not be accorded to them, saith the Lord of Spirits.<br>
<b>3</b> And in those days a whirlwind carried me off from the earth,<br>
And set me down at the end of the heavens. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> And there I saw another vision, the dwelling-places of the holy,<br>
And the resting-places of the righteous. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> Here mine eyes saw their dwellings with His righteous angels,<br>
And their resting-places with the holy. </p>

<p>And they petitioned and interceded and prayed for the children of men,<br>
And righteousness flowed before them as water, </p>

<p>And mercy like dew upon the earth:<br>
Thus it is amongst them for ever and ever. </p>

<p>6a And in that place mine eyes saw the Elect One of righteousness and of faith,<br>
7a And I saw his dwelling-place under the wings of the Lord of Spirits.<br>
6b And righteousness shall prevail in his days,<br>
And the righteous and elect shall be without number before Him for ever and ever.<br>
7b And all the righteous and elect before Him shall be strong as fiery lights,<br>
And their mouth shall be full of blessing, </p>

<p>And their lips extol the name of the Lord of Spirits,<br>
And righteousness before Him shall never fail,<br>
[And uprightness shall never fail before Him.] <br>
<b>8</b> There I wished to dwell,<br>
And my spirit longed for that dwelling-place: </p>

<p>And there heretofore hath been my portion,<br>
For so has it been established concerning me before the Lord of Spirits.<br>
<b>9</b> In those days I praised and extolled the name of the Lord of Spirits with
blessings and praises, because He hath destined me for blessing and glory according to the
good pleasure of the Lord of <b>10</b> Spirits. For a long time my eyes regarded that
place, and I blessed Him and praised Him, saying: Blessed is He, and may He be blessed
from the beginning and for evermore. And before Him there is no ceasing. He knows before
the world was created what is for ever and what will be from <b>12</b> generation unto
generation. Those who sleep not bless Thee: they stand before Thy glory and bless, praise,
and extol, saying: "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Spirits: He filleth the earth
with <b>3</b> spirits." And here my eyes saw all those who sleep not: they stand
before Him and bless and say: Blessed be Thou, and blessed be the name of the Lord for
ever and ever. And my face was changed; for I could no longer behold.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 40</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after that I saw thousands of thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand,
I saw a multitude <b>2</b> beyond number and reckoning, who stood before the Lord of
Spirits. And on the four sides of the Lord of Spirits I saw four presences, different from
those that sleep not, and I learnt their names: for the angel that went with me made known
to me their names, and showed me all the hidden things. <b>3</b> And I heard the voices of
those four presences as they uttered praises before the Lord of glory. 4,5 The first voice
blesses the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever. And the second voice I heard blessing <b>6</b>
the Elect One and the elect ones who hang upon the Lord of Spirits. And the third voice I
heard pray and intercede for those who dwell on the earth and supplicate in the name of
the Lord of Spirits. <b>7</b> And I heard the fourth voice fending off the Satans and
forbidding them to come before the Lord <b>8</b> of Spirits to accuse them who dwell on
the earth. After that I asked the angel of peace who went with me, who showed me
everything that is hidden: Who are these four presences which I have <b>9</b> seen and
whose words I have heard and written down? And he said to me: This first is Michael, the
merciful and long-suffering: and the second, who is set over all the diseases and all the
wounds of the children of men, is Raphael: and the third, who is set over all the powers,
is Gabriel: and the fourth, who is set over the repentance unto hope of those who inherit
eternal life, is named Phanuel. <b>10</b> And these are the four angels of the Lord of
Spirits and the four voices I heard in those days.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 41</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after that I saw all the secrets of the heavens, and how the kingdom is
divided, and how the <b>2</b> actions of men are weighed in the balance. And there I saw
the mansions of the elect and the mansions of the holy, and mine eyes saw there all the
sinners being driven from thence which deny the name of the Lord of Spirits, and being
dragged off: and they could not abide because of the punishment which proceeds from the
Lord of Spirits. 3 And there mine eyes saw the secrets of the lightning and of the
thunder, and the secrets of the winds, how they are divided to blow over the earth, and
the secrets of the clouds and dew, and there <b>4</b> I saw from whence they proceed in
that place and from whence they saturate the dusty earth. And there I saw closed chambers
out of which the winds are divided, the chamber of the hail and winds, the chamber of the
mist, and of the clouds, and the cloud thereof hovers over the earth from the <b>5</b>
beginning of the world. And I saw the chambers of the sun and moon, whence they proceed
and whither they come again, and their glorious return, and how one is superior to the
other, and their stately orbit, and how they do not leave their orbit, and they add
nothing to their orbit and they take nothing from it, and they keep faith with each other,
in accordance with the oath by which they 6 are bound together. And first the sun goes
forth and traverses his path according to the commandment <b>7</b> of the Lord of Spirits,
and mighty is His name for ever and ever. And after that I saw the hidden and the visible
path of the moon, and she accomplishes the course of her path in that place by day and by
night-the one holding a position opposite to the other before the Lord of Spirits. </p>

<p>And they give thanks and praise and rest not;<br>
For unto them is their thanksgiving rest.<br>
<b>8</b> For the sun changes oft for a blessing or a curse,<br>
And the course of the path of the moon is light to the righteous<br>
And darkness to the sinners in the name of the Lord,<br>
Who made a separation between the light and the darkness,<br>
And divided the spirits of men,<br>
And strengthened the spirits of the righteous,<br>
In the name of His righteousness. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> For no angel hinders and no power is able to hinder; for He appoints a judge for
them all and He judges them all before Him.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 42</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Wisdom found no place where she might dwell;<br>
Then a dwelling-place was assigned her in the heavens. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> Wisdom went forth to make her dwelling among the children of men,<br>
And found no dwelling-place: </p>

<p>Wisdom returned to her place,<br>
And took her seat among the angels. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And unrighteousness went forth from her chambers:<br>
Whom she sought not she found,<br>
And dwelt with them, </p>

<p>As rain in a desert<br>
And dew on a thirsty land.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 43</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I saw other lightnings and the stars of heaven, and I saw how He called them
all by their <b>2</b> names and they hearkened unto Him. And I saw how they are weighed in
a righteous balance according to their proportions of light: (I saw) the width of their
spaces and the day of their appearing, and how their revolution produces lightning: and (I
saw) their revolution according to the <b>3</b> number of the angels, and (how) they keep
faith with each other. And I asked the angel who went <b>4</b> with me who showed me what
was hidden: What are these? And he said to me: The Lord of Spirits hath showed thee their
parabolic meaning (lit. their parable): these are the names of the holy who dwell on the
earth and believe in the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 44</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>Also another phenomenon I saw in regard to the lightnings: how some of the stars arise
and become lightnings and cannot part with their new form.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 45</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And this is the second Parable concerning those who deny the name of the dwelling
of the holy ones and the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> And into the heaven they shall not ascend,<br>
And on the earth they shall not come:<br>
Such shall be the lot of the sinners<br>
Who have denied the name of the Lord of Spirits,<br>
Who are thus preserved for the day of suffering and tribulation. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> On that day Mine Elect One shall sit on the throne of glory<br>
And shall try their works,<br>
And their places of rest shall be innumerable. </p>

<p>And their souls shall grow strong within them when they see Mine Elect Ones,<br>
And those who have called upon My glorious name:<br>
<b>4</b> Then will I cause Mine Elect One to dwell among them. </p>

<p>And I will transform the heaven and make it an eternal blessing and light<br>
<b>5</b> And I will transform the earth and make it a blessing: </p>

<p>And I will cause Mine elect ones to dwell upon it:<br>
But the sinners and evil-doers shall not set foot thereon. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> For I have provided and satisfied with peace My righteous ones<br>
And have caused them to dwell before Me: </p>

<p>But for the sinners there is judgement impending with Me,<br>
So that I shall destroy them from the face of the earth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 46</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And there I saw One who had a head of days,<br>
And His head was white like wool,<br>
And with Him was another being whose countenance had the appearance of a man,<br>
And his face was full of graciousness, like one of the holy angels.<br>
<b>2</b> And I asked the angel who went with me and showed me all the hidden things,
concerning that <b>3</b> Son of Man, who he was, and whence he was, (and) why he went with
the Head of Days? And he answered and said unto me:<br>
This is the son of Man who hath righteousness,<br>
With whom dwelleth righteousness,<br>
And who revealeth all the treasures of that which is hidden, </p>

<p>Because the Lord of Spirits hath chosen him,<br>
And whose lot hath the pre-eminence before the Lord of Spirits in uprightness for ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> And this Son of Man whom thou hast seen<br>
Shall raise up the kings and the mighty from their seats,<br>
[And the strong from their thrones] <br>
And shall loosen the reins of the strong,<br>
And break the teeth of the sinners. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b>[And he shall put down the kings from their thrones and kingdoms] <br>
Because they do not extol and praise Him,<br>
Nor humbly acknowledge whence the kingdom was bestowed upon them.<br>
<b>6</b> And he shall put down the countenance of the strong,<br>
And shall fill them with shame. </p>

<p>And darkness shall be their dwelling,<br>
And worms shall be their bed,<br>
And they shall have no hope of rising from their beds,<br>
Because they do not extol the name of the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> And these are they who judge the stars of heaven,<br>
[And raise their hands against the Most High],<br>
And tread upon the earth and dwell upon it.<br>
And all their deeds manifest unrighteousness,<br>
And their power rests upon their riches,<br>
And their faith is in the gods which they have made with their hands,<br>
And they deny the name of the Lord of Spirits, </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> And they persecute the houses of His congregations,<br>
And the faithful who hang upon the name of the Lord of Spirits.</p>

<h3>Chapter 47</h3>

</b><p><b>1</b> And in those days shall have ascended the prayer of the righteous,<br>
And the blood of the righteous from the earth before the Lord of Spirits. </p>

Shall unite with one voice<br>
And supplicate and pray and praise,<br>
And give thanks and bless the name of the Lord of Spirits<br>
On behalf of the blood of the righteous which has been shed,<br>
And that the prayer of the righteous may not be in vain before the Lord of Spirits,<br>
That judgement may be done unto them,<br>
And that they may not have to suffer for ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> In those days I saw the Head of Days when He seated himself upon the throne of
His glory,<br>
And the books of the living were opened before Him:<br>
And all His host which is in heaven above and His counselors stood before Him, </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> And the hearts of the holy were filled with joy;<br>
Because the number of the righteous had been offered,<br>
And the prayer of the righteous had been heard,<br>

And their dwellings were with the righteous and holy and elect.<br>
<b>2</b> And at that hour that Son of Man was named In the presence of the Lord of

And his name before the Head of Days. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> Yea, before the sun and the signs were created,<br>
Before the stars of the heaven were made,<br>
His name was named before the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> He shall be a staff to the righteous whereon to stay themselves and not fall,<br>
And he shall be the light of the Gentiles,<br>
And the hope of those who are troubled of heart. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> All who dwell on earth shall fall down and worship before him,<br>
And will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And for this reason hath he been chosen and hidden before Him,<br>
Before the creation of the world and for evermore. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> And the wisdom of the Lord of Spirits hath revealed him to the holy and
righteous;<br>
For he hath preserved the lot of the righteous,<br>
Because they have hated and despised this world of unrighteousness,<br>
And have hated all its works and ways in the name of the Lord of Spirits:<br>
For in his name they are saved,<br>
And according to his good pleasure hath it been in regard to their life. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> In these days downcast in countenance shall the kings of the earth have become,<br>
And the strong who possess the land because of the works of their hands,<br>
For on the day of their anguish and affliction they shall not (be able to) save
themselves.<br>
And I will give them over into the hands of Mine elect:<br>
As straw in the fire so shall they burn before the face of the holy:<br>
As lead in the water shall they sink before the face of the righteous,<br>
And no trace of them shall any more be found.<br>
<br>
<b>10</b> And on the day of their affliction there shall be rest on the earth,<br>
And before them they shall fall and not rise again:<br>
And there shall be no one to take them with his hands and raise them:<br>

<p>1 And after those days in that place where I had seen all the visions of that which is
hidden -for <b>2</b> I had been carried off in a whirlwind and they had borne me towards
the west-There mine eyes saw all the secret things of heaven that shall be, a mountain of
iron, and a mountain of copper, and a mountain of silver, and a mountain of gold, and a
mountain of soft metal, and a mountain of lead. <b>3</b> And I asked the angel who went
with me, saying, What things are these which I have seen in <b>4</b> secret? And he said
unto me: All these things which thou hast seen shall serve the dominion of His Anointed
that he may be potent and mighty on the earth. <b>5</b> And that angel of peace answered,
saying unto me: Wait a little, and there shall be revealed unto thee all the secret things
which surround the Lord of Spirits.<br>

The mountain of iron, and the mountain of copper, and the mountain of silver,<br>

Nor shall one clothe oneself with a breastplate.<br>
Bronze shall be of no service,<br>

And the sinners devour all whom they lawlessly oppress:<br>
Yet the sinners shall be destroyed before the face of the Lord of Spirits,<br>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I looked and turned to another part of the earth, and saw there a deep valley
with burning <b>2</b> fire. And they brought the kings and the mighty, and began to cast
them into this deep valley. <b>3</b> And there mine eyes saw how they made these their
instruments, iron chains of immeasurable weight. <b>4</b> And I asked the angel of peace
who went with me, saying: For whom are these chains being prepared ? And he said unto me:
These are being prepared for the hosts of Azazel, so that they may take them and cast them
into the abyss of complete condemnation, and they shall cover their jaws with rough stones
as the Lord of Spirits commanded. <b>6</b> And Michael, and Gabriel, and Raphael, and
Phanuel shall take hold of them on that great day, and cast them on that day into the
burning furnace, that the Lord of Spirits may take vengeance on them for their
unrighteousness in becoming subject to Satan and leading astray those who dwell on the
earth. <b>7</b> And in those days shall punishment come from the Lord of Spirits, and he
will open all the chambers of waters which are above the heavens, and of the fountains
which are beneath the earth. <b>8</b> And all the waters shall be joined with the waters:
that which is above the heavens is the masculine, <b>9</b> and the water which is beneath
the earth is the feminine. And they shall destroy all who dwell <b>10</b> on the earth and
those who dwell under the ends of the heaven. And when they have recognized their
unrighteousness which they have wrought on the earth, then by these shall they perish.</p>

so to all who dwell on the earth, and I will set a sign in the heaven: and this shall be a
pledge of good faith between Me and them for ever, so long as heaven is above the earth.
And this is in accordance with My command. <b>3</b> When I have desired to take hold of
them by the hand of the angels on the day of tribulation and pain because of this, I will
cause My chastisement and My wrath to abide upon them, saith <b>4</b> God, the Lord of

with me, saying: To whom are <b>3</b> these who hold the scourges going ? And he said unto
me: To their elect and beloved ones, that they may be cast into the chasm of the abyss of
the valley. </p>
<b>

from heaven remarked it, and the pillars of the earth were moved from their place, and the

and how when it resounds above in the heaven, the sound thereof is heard, and he caused me
to see the judgements executed on the earth, whether they be for well-being and blessing,
or for a curse according to the word of the Lord of Spirits. <b>3</b> And after that all
the secrets of the lights and lightnings were shown to me, and they lighten for blessing

<h3>Chapter 60</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>A Fragment of the Book of Noah </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>1</b> In the year 500, in the seventh month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the
life of Enoch. In that Parable I saw how a mighty quaking made the heaven of heavens to
quake, and the host of the Most High, and the angels, a thousand thousands and ten
thousand times ten thousand, were <b>2</b> disquieted with a great disquiet. And the Head
of Days sat on the throne of His glory, and the angels and the righteous stood around Him.
</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And a great trembling seized me,<br>
And fear took hold of me,<br>
And my loins gave way,<br>
And dissolved were my reins,<br>
And I fell upon my face. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> And Michael sent another angel from among the holy ones and he raised me up, and
when he had raised me up my spirit returned; for I had not been able to endure the look of
this host, and the <b>5</b> commotion and the quaking of the heaven. And Michael said unto
me: Why art thou disquieted with such a vision ? Until this day lasted the day of His
mercy; and He hath been merciful and <b>6</b> long-suffering towards those who dwell on
the earth. And when the day, and the power, and the punishment, and the judgement come,
which the Lord of Spirits hath prepared for those who worship not the righteous law, and
for those who deny the righteous judgement, and for those who take His name in vain-that
day is prepared, for the elect a covenant, but for sinners an inquisition. <b>25</b> When
the punishment of the Lord of Spirits shall rest upon them, it shall rest in order that
the punishment of the Lord of Spirits may not come, in vain, and it shall slay the
children with their mothers and the children with their fathers. Afterwards the judgement
shall take place according to His mercy and His patience. <b>7</b> And on that day were
two monsters parted, a female monster named Leviathan, to dwell in the <b>8</b> abysses of
the ocean over the fountains of the waters. But the male is named Behemoth, who occupied
with his breast a waste wilderness named Duidain, on the east of the garden where the
elect and righteous dwell, where my grandfather was taken up, the seventh from Adam, the
first <b>9</b> man whom the Lord of Spirits created. And I besought the other angel that
he should show me the might of those monsters, how they were parted on one day and cast,
the one into the abysses <b>10</b> of the sea, and the other unto the dry land of the
wilderness. And he said to me: Thou son of man, herein thou dost seek to know what is
hidden. <b>11</b> And the other angel who went with me and showed me what was hidden told
me what is first and last in the heaven in the height, and beneath the earth in the depth,
and at the ends of the 12 heaven, and on the foundation of the heaven. And the chambers of
the winds, and how the winds are divided, and how they are weighed, and (how) the portals
of the winds are reckoned, each according to the power of the wind, and the power of the
lights of the moon, and according to the power that is fitting: and the divisions of the
stars according to their names, and how all the divisions <b>13</b> are divided. And the
thunders according to the places where they fall, and all the divisions that are made
among the lightnings that it may lighten, and their host that they may at once obey. <b>14</b>
For the thunder has places of rest (which) are assigned (to it) while it is waiting for
its peal; and the thunder and lightning are inseparable, and although not one and
undivided, they both go together 15 through the spirit and separate not. For when the
lightning lightens, the thunder utters its voice, and the spirit enforces a pause during
the peal, and divides equally between them; for the treasury of their peals is like the
sand, and each one of them as it peals is held in with a bridle, and turned back by the
power of the spirit, and pushed forward according to the many quarters of the earth. <b>16</b>
And the spirit of the sea is masculine and strong, and according to the might of his
strength he draws it back with a rein, and in like manner it is driven forward and
disperses amid all the mountains <b>17</b> of the earth. And the spirit of the hoar-frost
is his own angel, and the spirit of the hail is a good <b>18</b> angel. And the spirit of
the snow has forsaken his chambers on account of his strength -There is a special spirit
therein, and that which ascends from it is like smoke, and its name is frost. And the
spirit of the mist is not united with them in their chambers, but it has a special
chamber; for its course is glorious both in light and in darkness, and in winter and in
summer, and in its chamber is an angel. <b>20</b> And the spirit of the dew has its
dwelling at the ends of the heaven, and is connected with the chambers of the rain, and
its course is in winter and summer: and its clouds and the clouds of the <b>21</b> mist
are connected, and the one gives to the other. And when the spirit of the rain goes forth
from its chamber, the angels come and open the chamber and lead it out, and when it is
diffused over the whole earth it unites with the water on the earth. And whensoever it
unites with the water on <b>22</b> the earth . . . For the waters are for those who dwell
on the earth; for they are nourishment for the earth from the Most High who is in heaven:
therefore there is a measure for the rain, 22, and the angels take it in charge. And these
things I saw towards the Garden of the Righteous. <b>23</b> And the angel of peace who was
with me said to me: These two monsters, prepared conformably to the greatness of God,
shall feed . . .</p>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I saw in those days how long cords were given to those angels, and they took
to themselves wings and flew, and they went towards the north. <b>2</b> And I asked the
angel, saying unto him: Why have those (angels) taken these cords and gone off ? And he
said unto me: They have gone to measure. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And the angel who went with me said unto me:<br>
These shall bring the measures of the righteous,<br>

and one light like unto fire. </p>

And glorify and extol and sanctify the name of the Lord of Spirits. </p>

the host of God, the Cherubic, Seraphin and Ophannin, and all the angels of power, and all
the angels of principalities, and the Elect One, and the other powers on the earth (and)
over the water On that day shall raise one voice, and bless and glorify and exalt in the
spirit of faith, and in the spirit of wisdom, and in the spirit of patience, and in the
spirit of mercy, and in the spirit of judgement and of peace, and in the spirit of
goodness, and shall all say with one voice: " Blessed is He, and may the name of the
Lord of Spirits be blessed for ever and ever." </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>12</b> All who sleep not above in heaven shall bless Him:<br>
All the holy ones who are in heaven shall bless Him,<br>
And all the elect who dwell in the garden of life: </p>

<p>And every spirit of light who is able to bless, and glorify, and extol, and hallow Thy
blessed name,<br>
And all flesh shall beyond measure glorify and bless Thy name for ever and ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>13</b> For great is the mercy of the Lord of Spirits, and He is long-suffering,<br>

</b><p><b>1</b> And thus the Lord commanded the kings and the mighty and the exalted, and those
who dwell on the earth, and said: </p>

<p>Open your eyes and lift up your horns if ye are able to recognize the Elect One.<br>
<b>2</b> And the Lord of Spirits seated him on the throne of His glory,<br>
And the spirit of righteousness was poured out upon him,<br>
And the word of his mouth slays all the sinners,<br>
And all the unrighteous are destroyed from before his face.<br>
<b>3</b> And there shall stand up in that day all the kings and the mighty,<br>
And the exalted and those who hold the earth,<br>
And they shall see and recognize How he sits on the throne of his glory,<br>
And righteousness is judged before him,<br>
And no lying word is spoken before him. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> Then shall pain come upon them as on a woman in travail,<br>
[And she has pain in bringing forth] <br>
When her child enters the mouth of the womb,<br>
And she has pain in bringing forth. </p>

<p>And one portion of them shall look on the other,<br>
And they shall be terrified,<br>
And they shall be downcast of countenance,<br>
And pain shall seize them,<br>
When they see that Son of Man Sitting on the throne of his glory. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And the kings and the mighty and all who possess the earth shall bless and
glorify and extol him who rules over all, who was hidden. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> For from the beginning the Son of Man was hidden,<br>
And the Most High preserved him in the presence of His might,<br>
And revealed him to the elect. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> And the congregation of the elect and holy shall be sown,<br>
And all the elect shall stand before him on that day. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> And all the kings and the mighty and the exalted and those who rule the earth<br>
Shall fall down before him on their faces,<br>
And worship and set their hope upon that Son of Man,<br>
And petition him and supplicate for mercy at his hands. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>10</b> Nevertheless that Lord of Spirits will so press them<br>
That they shall hastily go forth from His presence,<br>
And their faces shall be filled with shame,<br>
And the darkness grow deeper on their faces. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>11</b> And He will deliver them to the angels for punishment,<br>
To execute vengeance on them because they have oppressed His children and His elect <br>
<b>12</b> And they shall be a spectacle for the righteous and for His elect:<br>
They shall rejoice over them,<br>
Because the wrath of the Lord of Spirits resteth upon them,<br>
And His sword is drunk with their blood. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>13</b> And the righteous and elect shall be saved on that day,<br>
And they shall never thenceforward see the face of the sinners and unrighteous. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>14</b> And the Lord of Spirits will abide over them,<br>
And with that Son of Man shall they eat<br>
And lie down and rise up for ever and ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>15</b> And the righteous and elect shall have risen from the earth,<br>
And ceased to be of downcast countenance.<br>
And they shall have been clothed with garments of glory, </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>16</b> And these shall be the garments of life from the Lord of Spirits: </p>

<p>And your garments shall not grow old,<br>
Nor your glory pass away before the Lord of Spirits.</p>

<h3>Chapter 63</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> In those days shall the mighty and the kings who possess the earth implore (Him)
to grant them a little respite from His angels of punishment to whom they were delivered,
that they might fall <b>2</b> down and worship before the Lord of Spirits, and confess
their sins before Him. And they shall bless and glorify the Lord of Spirits, and say: </p>

<p>Blessed is the Lord of Spirits and the Lord of kings,<br>
And the Lord of the mighty and the Lord of the rich,<br>
And the Lord of glory and the Lord of wisdom, </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And splendid in every secret thing is Thy power from generation to generation,<br>
And Thy glory for ever and ever: </p>

<p>Deep are all Thy secrets and innumerable,<br>
And Thy righteousness is beyond reckoning. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> We have now learnt that we should glorify<br>
And bless the Lord of kings and Him who is king over all kings.<br>
<b>5</b> And they shall say:<br>
Would that we had rest to glorify and give thanks<br>
And confess our faith before His glory ! </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And now we long for a little rest but find it not:<br>
We follow hard upon and obtain (it) not: </p>

<p>And light has vanished from before us,<br>
And darkness is our dwelling-place for ever and ever: </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> For we have not believed before Him<br>
Nor glorified the name of the Lord of Spirits, [nor glorified our Lord] </p>

<p>But our hope was in the sceptre of our kingdom,<br>
And in our glory. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> And in the day of our suffering and tribulation He saves us not,<br>
And we find no respite for confession </p>

<p>That our Lord is true in all His works, and in His judgements and His justice,<br>
And His judgements have no respect of persons. </p>

<p>And we pass away from before His face on account of our works,<br>
And all our sins are reckoned up in righteousness. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>10</b> Now they shall say unto themselves: Our souls are full of unrighteous gain, but
it does not prevent us from descending from the midst thereof into the burden of Sheol. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>11</b> And after that their faces shall be filled with darkness<br>
And shame before that Son of Man,<br>
And they shall be driven from his presence,<br>
And the sword shall abide before his face in their midst. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>12</b> Thus spake the Lord of Spirits: This is the ordinance and judgement with respect
to the mighty and the kings and the exalted and those who possess the earth before the
Lord of Spirits.</p>

<h3>Chapter 64</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b>,<b>2</b> And other forms I saw hidden in that place. I heard the voice of the
angel saying: These are the angels who descended to the earth, and revealed what was
hidden to the children of men and seduced the children of men into committing sin.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 65</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1, <b>2</b> And in those days Noah saw the earth that it had sunk down and its
destruction was nigh. And he arose from thence and went to the ends of the earth, and
cried aloud to his grandfather Enoch: <b>3</b> and Noah said three times with an
embittered voice: Hear me, hear me, hear me. And I said unto him: Tell me what it is that
is falling out on the earth that the earth is in such evil plight <b>4</b> and shaken,
lest perchance I shall perish with it ? And thereupon there was a great commotion , on the
earth, and a voice was heard from heaven, and I fell on my face. And Enoch my grandfather
came and stood by me, and said unto me: Why hast thou cried unto me with a bitter cry and
weeping <b>6</b> And a command has gone forth from the presence of the Lord concerning
those who dwell on the earth that their ruin is accomplished because they have learnt all
the secrets of the angels, and all the violence of the Satans, and all their powers -the
most secret ones- and all the power of those who practice sorcery, and the power of
witchcraft, and the power of those who make molten images <b>7</b> for the whole earth:
And how silver is produced from the dust of the earth, and how soft metal <b>8</b>
originates in the earth. For lead and tin are not produced from the earth like the first:
it is a fountain <b>9</b> that produces them, and an angel stands therein, and that angel
is pre-eminent. And after that my grandfather Enoch took hold of me by my hand and raised
me up, and said unto me: Go, for I have <b>10</b> asked the Lord of Spirits as touching
this commotion on the earth. And He said unto me: " Because of their unrighteousness
their judgement has been determined upon and shall not be withheld by Me for ever. Because
of the sorceries which they have searched out and learnt, the earth and those <b>11</b>
who dwell upon it shall be destroyed." And these-they have no place of repentance for
ever, because they have shown them what was hidden, and they are the damned: but as for
thee, my son, the Lord of Spirits knows that thou art pure, and guiltless of this reproach
concerning the secrets. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>12</b> And He has destined thy name to be among the holy,<br>
And will preserve thee amongst those who dwell on the earth,<br>
And has destined thy righteous seed both for kingship and for great honours,<br>
And from thy seed shall proceed a fountain of the righteous and holy without number for
ever.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 66</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after that he showed me the angels of punishment who are prepared to come and
let loose all the powers of the waters which are beneath in the earth in order to bring
judgement and destruction <b>2</b> on all who [abide and] dwell on the earth. And the Lord
of Spirits gave commandment to the angels who were going forth, that they should not cause
the waters to rise but should hold them <b>3</b> in check; for those angels were over the
powers of the waters. And I went away from the presence of Enoch.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 67</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And in those days the word of God came unto me, and He said unto me: Noah, thy
lot has come <b>2</b> Up before Me, a lot without blame, a lot of love and uprightness.
And now the angels are making a wooden (building), and when they have completed that task
I will place My hand upon it and preserve it, and there shall come forth from it the seed
of life, and a change shall set in so that the <b>3</b> earth will not remain without
inhabitant. And I will make fast thy sed before me for ever and ever, and I will spread
abroad those who dwell with thee: it shall not be unfruitful on the face of the earth, but
it shall be blessed and multiply on the earth in the name of the Lord. <b>4</b> And He
will imprison those angels, who have shown unrighteousness, in that burning valley which
my grandfather Enoch had formerly shown to me in the west among the mountains of gold <b>5</b>
and silver and iron and soft metal and tin. And I saw that valley in which there was a
great <b>6</b> convulsion and a convulsion of the waters. And when all this took place,
from that fiery molten metal and from the convulsion thereof in that place, there was
produced a smell of sulphur, and it was connected with those waters, and that valley of
the angels who had led astray (mankind) burned <b>7</b> beneath that land. And through its
valleys proceed streams of fire, where these angels are punished who had led astray those
who dwell upon the earth. 8 But those waters shall in those days serve for the kings and
the mighty and the exalted, and those who dwell on the earth, for the healing of the body,
but for the punishment of the spirit; now their spirit is full of lust, that they may be
punished in their body, for they have denied the Lord of Spirits <b>9</b> and see their
punishment daily, and yet believe not in His name. And in proportion as the burning of
their bodies becomes severe, a corresponding change shall take place in their spirit for
ever and ever; <b>10</b> for before the Lord of Spirits none shall utter an idle word. For
the judgement shall come upon them, <b>11</b> because they believe in the lust of their
body and deny the Spirit of the Lord. And those same waters will undergo a change in those
days; for when those angels are punished in these waters, these water-springs shall change
their temperature, and when the angels ascend, this water of the <b>12</b> springs shall
change and become cold. And I heard Michael answering and saying: This judgement wherewith
the angels are judged is a testimony for the kings and the mighty who possess the <b>13</b>
earth. Because these waters of judgement minister to the healing of the body of the kings
and the lust of their body; therefore they will not see and will not believe that those
waters will change and become a fire which burns for ever.</p>

<h3>Chapter 68</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after that my grandfather Enoch gave me the teaching of all the secrets in
the book in the Parables which had been given to him, and he put them together for me in
the words of the book <b>2</b> of the Parables. And on that day Michael answered Raphael
and said: The power of the spirit transports and makes me to tremble because of the
severity of the judgement of the secrets, the judgement of the angels: who can endure the
severe judgement which has been executed, and before <b>3</b> which they melt away ? And
Michael answered again, and said to Raphael: Who is he whose heart is not softened
concerning it, and whose reins are not troubled by this word of judgement <b>4</b> (that)
has gone forth upon them because of those who have thus led them out ? And it came to pass
when he stood before the Lord of Spirits, Michael said thus to Raphael: I will not take
their part under the eye of the Lord; for the Lord of Spirits has been angry with them
because they do <b>5</b> as if they were the Lord. Therefore all that is hidden shall come
upon them for ever and ever; for neither angel nor man shall have his portion (in it), but
alone they have received their judgement for ever and ever.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 69</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after this judgement they shall terrify and make them to tremble because they
have shown this to those who dwell on the earth. <b>2</b> And behold the names of those
angels [and these are their names: the first of them is Samjaza, the second Artaqifa, and
the third Armen, the fourth Kokabel, the fifth Turael, the sixth Rumjal, the seventh
Danjal, the eighth Neqael, the ninth Baraqel, the tenth Azazel, the eleventh Armaros, the
twelfth Batarjal, the thirteenth Busasejal, the fourteenth Hananel, the fifteenth Turel,
and the sixteenth Simapesiel, the seventeenth Jetrel, the eighteenth Tumael, the
nineteenth Turel, 3 the twentieth Rumael, the twenty-first Azazel. And these are the
chiefs of their angels and their names, and their chief ones over hundreds and over
fifties and over tens. <b>4</b> The name of the first Jeqon: that is, the one who led
astray [all] the sons of God, and brought them <b>5</b> down to the earth, and led them
astray through the daughters of men. And the second was named Asbeel: he imparted to the
holy sons of God evil counsel, and led them astray so that they defiled <b>6</b> their
bodies with the daughters of men. And the third was named Gadreel: he it is who showed the
children of men all the blows of death, and he led astray Eve, and showed [the weapons of
death to the sons of men] the shield and the coat of mail, and the sword for battle, and
all the weapons <b>7</b> of death to the children of men. And from his hand they have
proceeded against those who dwell <b>8</b> on the earth from that day and for evermore.
And the fourth was named Penemue: he taught the <b>9</b> children of men the bitter and
the sweet, and he taught them all the secrets of their wisdom. And he instructed mankind
in writing with ink and paper, and thereby many sinned from eternity to <b>10</b> eternity
and until this day. For men were not created for such a purpose, to give confirmation <b>11</b>
to their good faith with pen and ink. For men were created exactly like the angels, to the
intent that they should continue pure and righteous, and death, which destroys everything,
could not have taken hold of them, but through this their knowledge they are perishing,
and through this power <b>12</b> it is consuming me. And the fifth was named Kasdeja: this
is he who showed the children of men all the wicked smitings of spirits and demons, and
the smitings of the embryo in the womb, that it may pass away, and [the smitings of the
soul] the bites of the serpent, and the smitings <b>13</b> which befall through the
noontide heat, the son of the serpent named Tabaet. And this is the task of Kasbeel, the
chief of the oath which he showed to the holy ones when he dwelt high 4 above in glory,
and its name is Biqa. This (angel) requested Michael to show him the hidden name, that he
might enunciate it in the oath, so that those might quake before that name and oath who
revealed all that was in secret to the children of men. And this is the power of this
oath, for it is powerful and strong, and he placed this oath Akae in the hand of Michael. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>16</b> And these are the secrets of this oath . . .<br>
And they are strong through his oath:<br>
And the heaven was suspended before the world was created,<br>
And for ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>17</b> And through it the earth was founded upon the water,<br>
And from the secret recesses of the mountains come beautiful waters,<br>
From the creation of the world and unto eternity. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>18</b> And through that oath the sea was created,<br>
And as its foundation He set for it the sand against the time of (its) anger,<br>
And it dare not pass beyond it from the creation of the world unto eternity. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> And through that oath are the depths made fast,<br>
And abide and stir not from their place from eternity to eternity. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>20</b> And through that oath the sun and moon complete their course,<br>
And deviate not from their ordinance from eternity to eternity. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>21</b> And through that oath the stars complete their course,<br>
And He calls them by their names,<br>
And they answer Him from eternity to eternity. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>22</b> [And in like manner the spirits of the water, and of the winds, and of all
zephyrs, and (their) paths <b>23</b> from all the quarters of the winds. And there are
preserved the voices of the thunder and the light of the lightnings: and there are
preserved the chambers of the hail and the chambers of the <b>24</b> hoarfrost, and the
chambers of the mist, and the chambers of the rain and the dew. And all these believe and
give thanks before the Lord of Spirits, and glorify (Him) with all their power, and their
food is in every act of thanksgiving: they thank and glorify and extol the name of the
Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.] </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>25</b> And this oath is mighty over them<br>
And through it [they are preserved and] their paths are preserved,<br>
And their course is not destroyed. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>26</b> And there was great joy amongst them,<br>
And they blessed and glorified and extolled<br>
Because the name of that Son of Man had been revealed unto them. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>27</b> And he sat on the throne of his glory,<br>
And the sum of judgement was given unto the Son of Man,<br>
And he caused the sinners to pass away and be destroyed from off the face of the earth,<br>
And those who have led the world astray. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>28</b> With chains shall they be bound,<br>
And in their assemblage-place of destruction shall they be imprisoned,<br>
And all their works vanish from the face of the earth. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>29</b> And from henceforth there shall be nothing corruptible;<br>
For that Son of Man has appeared,<br>
And has seated himself on the throne of his glory,<br>
And all evil shall pass away before his face,<br>
And the word of that Son of Man shall go forth </p>

<p>And be strong before the Lord of Spirits.</p>

</b><p><b>1</b> And it came to pass after this that his name during his lifetime was raised aloft
to that Son of <b>2</b> Man and to the Lord of Spirits from amongst those who dwell on the
earth. And he was raised aloft <b>3</b> on the chariots of the spirit and his name
vanished among them. And from that day I was no longer numbered amongst them: and he set
me between the two winds, between the North and the <b>4</b> West, where the angels took
the cords to measure for me the place for the elect and righteous. And there I saw the
first fathers and the righteous who from the beginning dwell in that place.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 71</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And it came to pass after this that my spirit was translated<br>
And it ascended into the heavens:<br>
And I saw the holy sons of God.<br>
They were stepping on flames of fire:<br>
Their garments were white [and their raiment] ,<br>
And their faces shone like snow. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> And I saw two streams of fire,<br>
And the light of that fire shone like hyacinth,<br>
And I fell on my face before the Lord of Spirits. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And the angel Michael[one of the archangels] seized me by my right hand,<br>
And lifted me up and led me forth into all the secrets,<br>
And he showed me all the secrets of righteousness. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> And he showed me all the secrets of the ends of the heaven,<br>
And all the chambers of all the stars, and all the luminaries,<br>
Whence they proceed before the face of the holy ones. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> And he translated my spirit into the heaven of heavens,<br>
And I saw there as it were a structure built of crystals,<br>
And between those crystals tongues of living fire. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And my spirit saw the girdle which girt that house of fire,<br>
And on its four sides were streams full of living fire,<br>
And they girt that house. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> And round about were Seraphin, Cherubic, and Ophannin:<br>
And these are they who sleep not<br>
And guard the throne of His glory. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> And I saw angels who could not be counted,<br>
A thousand thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand,<br>
Encircling that house. </p>

<p>And Michael, and Raphael, and Gabriel, and Phanuel,<br>
And the holy angels who are above the heavens,<br>
Go in and out of that house. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> And they came forth from that house,<br>
And Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and Phanuel,<br>
And many holy angels without number. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>10</b> And with them the Head of Days,<br>
His head white and pure as wool,<br>
And His raiment indescribable. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>11</b> And I fell on my face,<br>
And my whole body became relaxed,<br>
And my spirit was transfigured; </p>

<p>And I cried with a loud voice, . . .<br>
with the spirit of power,<br>
And blessed and glorified and extolled. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>12</b> And these blessings which went forth out of my mouth were well pleasing before
that Head of Days. And that Head of Days came with Michael and Gabriel, Raphael and
Phanuel, thousands and ten thousands of angels without number. </p>

<p>[Lost passage wherein the Son of Man was described as accompanying the Head of Days,
and Enoch asked one of the angels (as in xlvi. 3) concerning the Son of Man as to who he
was.] </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>14</b> And he (i.e. the angel) came to me and greeted me with His voice, and said unto
me <br>
This is the Son of Man who is born unto righteousness,<br>
And righteousness abides over him,<br>
And the righteousness of the Head of Days forsakes him not.<br>
<b>15</b> And he said unto me:<br>
He proclaims unto thee peace in the name of the world to come;<br>
For from hence has proceeded peace since the creation of the world,<br>
And so shall it be unto thee for ever and for ever and ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>16</b> And all shall walk in his ways since righteousness never forsaketh him:<br>
With him will be their dwelling-places, and with him their heritage,<br>
And they shall not be separated from him for ever and ever and ever. </p>

<p>And so there shall be length of days with that Son of Man,<br>
And the righteous shall have peace and an upright way<br>
In the name of the Lord of Spirits for ever and ever.</p>

<h3>Chapter 72</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> The book of the courses of the luminaries of the heaven, the relations of each,
according to their classes, their dominion and their seasons, according to their names and
places of origin, and according to their months, which Uriel, the holy angel, who was with
me, who is their guide, showed me; and he showed me all their laws exactly as they are,
and how it is with regard to all the years of the world <b>2</b> and unto eternity, till
the new creation is accomplished which dureth till eternity. And this is the first law of
the luminaries: the luminary the Sun has its rising in the eastern portals of the heaven, <b>3</b>
and its setting in the western portals of the heaven. And I saw six portals in which the
sun rises, and six portals in which the sun sets and the moon rises and sets in these
portals, and the leaders of the stars and those whom they lead: six in the east and six in
the west, and all following each other <b>4</b> in accurately corresponding order: also
many windows to the right and left of these portals. And first there goes forth the great
luminary, named the Sun, and his circumference is like the <b>5</b> circumference of the
heaven, and he is quite filled with illuminating and heating fire. The chariot on which he
ascends, the wind drives, and the sun goes down from the heaven and returns through the
north in order to reach the east, and is so guided that he comes to the appropriate (lit.
that ) portal and <b>6</b> shines in the face of the heaven. In this way he rises in the
first month in the great portal, which <b>7</b> is the fourth [those six portals in the
cast]. And in that fourth portal from which the sun rises in the first month are twelve
window-openings, from which proceed a flame when they are opened in <b>8</b> their season.
When the sun rises in the heaven, he comes forth through that fourth portal thirty, <b>9</b>
mornings in succession, and sets accurately in the fourth portal in the west of the
heaven. And during this period the day becomes daily longer and the night nightly shorter
to the thirtieth <b>10</b> morning. On that day the day is longer than the night by a
ninth part, and the day amounts exactly to ten parts and the night to eight parts. And the
sun rises from that fourth portal, and sets in the fourth and returns to the fifth portal
of the east thirty mornings, and rises from it and sets in the fifth <b>12</b> portal. And
then the day becomes longer by two parts and amounts to eleven parts, and the night <b>13</b>
becomes shorter and amounts to seven parts. And it returns to the east and enters into the
sixth 14 portal, and rises and sets in the sixth portal one-and-thirty mornings on account
of its sign. On that day the day becomes longer than the night, and the day becomes double
the night, and the day <b>15</b> becomes twelve parts, and the night is shortened and
becomes six parts. And the sun mounts up to make the day shorter and the night longer, and
the sun returns to the east and enters into the <b>16</b> sixth portal, and rises from it
and sets thirty mornings. And when thirty mornings are accomplished, <b>17</b> the day
decreases by exactly one part, and becomes eleven parts, and the night seven. And the sun
goes forth from that sixth portal in the west, and goes to the east and rises in the fifth
portal for <b>18</b> thirty mornings, and sets in the west again in the fifth western
portal. On that day the day decreases by two parts, and amounts to ten parts and the night
to eight parts. And the sun goes forth from that fifth portal and sets in the fifth portal
of the west, and rises in the fourth portal for one- <b>20</b> and-thirty mornings on
account of its sign, and sets in the west. On that day the day is equalized with the
night, [and becomes of equal length] , and the night amounts to nine parts and the day to <b>21</b>
nine parts. And the sun rises from that portal and sets in the west, and returns to the
east and rises <b>22</b> thirty mornings in the third portal and sets in the west in the
third portal. And on that day the night becomes longer than the day, and night becomes
longer than night, and day shorter than day till the thirtieth morning, and the night
amounts exactly to ten parts and the day to eight <b>23</b> parts. And the sun rises from
that third portal and sets in the third portal in the west and returns to the east, and
for thirty mornings rises <b>24</b> in the second portal in the east, and in like manner
sets in the second portal in the west of the heaven. And on that day the night amounts to
eleven 25 parts and the day to seven parts. And the sun rises on that day from that second
portal and sets in the west in the second portal, and returns to the east into the first
portal for one-and-thirty <b>26</b> mornings, and sets in the first portal in the west of
the heaven. And on that day the night becomes longer and amounts to the double of the day:
and the night amounts exactly to twelve parts and <b>27</b> the day to six. And the sun
has (therewith) traversed the divisions of his orbit and turns again on those divisions of
his orbit, and enters that portal thirty mornings and sets also in the west <b>28</b>
opposite to it. And on that night has the night decreased in length by a ninth part, and
the night <b>29</b> has become eleven parts and the day seven parts. And the sun has
returned and entered into the second portal in the east, and returns on those his
divisions of his orbit for thirty mornings, rising <b>30</b> and setting. And on that day
the night decreases in length, and the night amounts to ten parts <b>31</b> and the day to
eight. And on that day the sun rises from that portal, and sets in the west, and returns
to the east, and rises in the third portal for one-and-thirty mornings, and sets in the
west of the heaven. <b>32</b> On that day the night decreases and amounts to nine parts,
and the day to nine parts, and the night <b>33</b> is equal to the day and the year is
exactly as to its days three hundred and sixty-four. And the length of the day and of the
night, and the shortness of the day and of the night arise-through the course <b>34</b> of
the sun these distinctions are made (lit. they are separated ). So it comes that its
course becomes 35 daily longer, and its course nightly shorter. And this is the law and
the course of the sun, and his return as often as he returns sixty times and rises, i.e.
the great luminary which is named the sun, for ever and ever. And that which (thus) rises
is the great luminary, and is so named according to <b>37</b> its appearance, according as
the Lord commanded. As he rises, so he sets and decreases not, and rests not, but runs day
and night, and his light is sevenfold brighter than that of the moon; but as regards size
they are both equal.</p>

<h3>Chapter 73</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after this law I saw another law dealing with the smaller luminary, which is
named the Moon. And her circumference is like the circumference of the heaven, and her
chariot in which she rides is driven by the wind, and light is given to her in (definite)
measure. And her rising and setting change every month: and her days are like the days of
the sun, and when her light is uniform (i.e. full) it amounts to the seventh part of the
light of the sun. And thus she rises. And her first phase in the east comes forth on the
thirtieth morning: and on that day she becomes visible, and constitutes for you the first
phase of the moon on the thirtieth day together with the sun in the portal where the sun
rises. And the one half of her goes forth by a seventh part, and her whole circumference
is empty, without light, with the exception of one-seventh part of it, (and) the <b>6</b>
fourteenth part of her light. And when she receives one-seventh part of the half of her
light, her light 7 amounts to one-seventh part and the half thereof. And she sets with the
sun, and when the sun rises the moon rises with him and receives the half of one part of
light, and in that night in the beginning of her morningin the commencement of the lunar
day </p>

<p>the moon sets with the sun, and <b>8</b> is invisible that night with the fourteen
parts and the half of one of them. And she rises on that day with exactly a seventh part,
and comes forth and recedes from the rising of the sun, and in her remaining days she
becomes bright in the (remaining) thirteen parts.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 74</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I saw another course, a law for her, (and) how according to that law she
performs her monthly <b>2</b> revolution. And all these Uriel, the holy angel who is the
leader of them all, showed to me, and their positions, and I wrote down their positions as
he showed them to me, and I wrote down their months <b>3</b> as they were, and the
appearance of their lights till fifteen days were accomplished. In single seventh parts
she accomplishes all her light in the east, and in single seventh parts accomplishes all
her <b>4</b> darkness in the west. And in certain months she alters her settings, and in
certain months she pursues <b>5</b> her own peculiar course. In two months the moon sets
with the sun: in those two middle portals the <b>6</b> third and the fourth. She goes
forth for seven days, and turns about and returns again through the portal where the sun
rises, and accomplishes all her light: and she recedes from the sun, and in eight <b>7</b>
days enters the sixth portal from which the sun goes forth. And when the sun goes forth
from the fourth portal she goes forth seven days, until she goes forth from the fifth and
turns back again in seven days into the fourth portal and accomplishes all her light: and
she recedes and enters into the <b>8</b> first portal in eight days. And she returns again
in seven days into the fourth portal from which the 9, <b>10</b> sun goes forth. Thus I
saw their position -how the moons rose and the sun set in those days. And if five years
are added together the sun has an overplus of thirty days, and all the days which accrue <b>11</b>
to it for one of those five years, when they are full, amount to 364 days. And the
overplus of the sun and of the stars amounts to six days: in <b>5</b> years <b>6</b> days
every year come to <b>30</b> days: and the <b>12</b> moon falls behind the sun and stars
to the number of 30 days. And the sun and the stars bring in all the years exactly, so
that they do not advance or delay their position by a single day unto eternity; but
complete the years with perfect justice in 364 days. In <b>3</b> years there are 1,092
days, and in <b>5</b> years 1,820 days, so that in 8 years there are 2,912 days. For the
moon alone the days amount in <b>3</b> years to 1,062 days, and in <b>5</b> years she
falls <b>50</b> days behind:i.e. to the sum (of 1,770) there is <b>5</b> to be added
(1,000 and) <b>62</b> days. </p>

<p>And in <b>5</b> years there are 1,770 days, so that for the moon the days 6 in <b>8</b>
years amount to 21,832 days.For in <b>8</b> years she falls behind to the amount of <b>80</b>
days </p>

<p>, all the <b>17</b> days she falls behind in <b>8</b> years are <b>80</b>. And the year
is accurately completed in conformity with their world-stations and the stations of the
sun, which rise from the portals through which it (the sun) rises and sets <b>30</b> days.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 75</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And the leaders of the heads of the thousands, who are placed over the whole
creation and over all the stars, have also to do with the four intercalary days, being
inseparable from their office, according to the reckoning of the year, and these render
service on the four days which are not <b>2</b> reckoned in the reckoning of the year. And
owing to them men go wrong therein, for those luminaries truly render service on the
world-stations, one in the first portal, one in the third portal of the heaven, one in the
fourth portal, and one in the sixth portal, and the exactness of the year is <b>3</b>
accomplished through its separate three hundred and sixty-four stations. For the signs and
the times and the years and the days the angel Uriel showed to me, whom the Lord of glory
hath set for ever over all the luminaries of the heaven, in the heaven and in the world,
that they should rule on the face of the heaven and be seen on the earth, and be leaders
for the day and the night, i.e. the sun, moon, and stars, and all the ministering
creatures which make their revolution in all the chariots <b>4</b> of the heaven. In like
manner twelve doors Uriel showed me, open in the circumference of the suns chariot in the
heaven, through which the rays of the sun break forth: and from them is warmth <b>5</b>
diffused over the earth, when they are opened at their appointed seasons.And for the winds
and <b>6</b> the spirit of the dew when they are opened, standing open in the heavens at
the ends. </p>

<p>As for the twelve portals in the heaven, at the ends of the earth, out of which go
forth the sun, moon, and stars, <b>7</b> and all the works of heaven in the east and in
the west, There are many windows open to the left and right of them, and one window at its
(appointed) season produces warmth, corresponding (as these do) to those doors from which
the stars come forth according as He has commanded them, <b>8</b> and wherein they set
corresponding to their number. And I saw chariots in the heaven, running <b>9</b> in the
world, above those portals in which revolve the stars that never set. And one is larger
than all the rest, and it is that that makes its course through the entire world.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 76</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And at the ends of the earth I saw twelve portals open to all the quarters (of
the heaven), from <b>2</b> which the winds go forth and blow over the earth. Three of them
are open on the face (i.e. the east) of the heavens, and three in the west, and three on
the right (i.e. the south) of the heaven, and <b>3</b> three on the left (i.e. the north).
And the three first are those of the east, and three are of the <b>4</b> north, and
threeafter those on the left </p>

<p>of the south, and three of the west. Through four of these come winds of blessing and
prosperity, and from those eight come hurtful winds: when they are sent, they bring
destruction on all the earth and on the water upon it, and on all who dwell thereon, and
on everything which is in the water and on the land. <b>5</b> And the first wind from
those portals, called the east wind, comes forth through the first portal which is in the
east, inclining towards the south: from it come forth desolation, drought, heat, <b>6</b>
and destruction. And through the second portal in the middle comes what is fitting, and
from it there come rain and fruitfulness and prosperity and dew; and through the third
portal which lies toward the north come cold and drought. <b>7</b> And after these come
forth the south winds through three portals: through the first portal of <b>8</b> them
inclining to the east comes forth a hot wind. And through the middle portal next to it
there <b>9</b> come forth fragrant smells, and dew and rain, and prosperity and health.
And through the third portal lying to the west come forth dew and rain, locusts and
desolation. <b>10</b> And after these the north winds: from the seventh portal in the east
come dew and rain, locusts and desolation. And from the middle portal come in a direct
direction health and rain and dew and prosperity; and through the third portal in the west
come cloud and hoar-frost, and snow and rain, and dew and locusts. <b>12</b> And after
thesefour </p>

<p>are the west winds: through the first portal adjoining the north come forth dew and
hoar-frost, and cold and snow and frost. And from the middle portal come forth dew and
rain, and prosperity and blessing; and through the last portal which adjoins the south
come forth drought and desolation, and burning and destruction. And the twelve portals of
the four quarters of the heaven are therewith completed, and all their laws and all their
plagues and all their benefactions have I shown to thee, my son Methuselah.</p>

<h3>Chapter 77</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And the first quarter is called the east, because it is the first: and the
second, the south, because the Most High will descend there, yea, there in quite a special
sense will He who is blessed for ever <b>2</b> descend. And the west quarter is named the
diminished, because there all the luminaries of the <b>3</b> heaven wane and go down. And
the fourth quarter, named the north, is divided into three parts: the first of them is for
the dwelling of men: and the second contains seas of water, and the abysses and forests
and rivers, and darkness and clouds; and the third part contains the garden of
righteousness. <b>4</b> I saw seven high mountains, higher than all the mountains which
are on the earth: and thence <b>5</b> comes forth hoar-frost, and days, seasons, and years
pass away. I saw seven rivers on the earth larger than all the rivers: one of them coming
from the west pours its waters into the Great Sea. <b>6</b> And these two come from the
north to the sea and pour their waters into the Erythraean Sea in the <b>7</b> east. And
the remaining, four come forth on the side of the north to their own sea, two of them to
the Erythraean Sea, and two into the Great Sea and discharge themselves thereand some say:
<b>8</b> into the desert </p>

<p>. Seven great islands I saw in the sea and in the mainland: two in the mainland and
five in the Great Sea.</p>

<h3>Chapter 78</h3>
<font size="2">

<p>1, <b>2</b> And the names of the sun are the following: the first Orjares, and the
second Tomas. And the moon has four names: the first name is Asonja, the second Ebla, the
third Benase, and the fourth <b>3</b> Erae. These are the two great luminaries: their
circumference is like the circumference of the <b>4</b> heaven, and the size of the
circumference of both is alike. In the circumference of the sun there are seven portions
of light which are added to it more than to the moon, and in definite measures it is s
transferred till the seventh portion of the sun is exhausted. And they set and enter the
portals of the west, and make their revolution by the north, and come forth through the
eastern portals <b>6</b> on the face of the heaven. And when the moon rises one-fourteenth
part appears in the heaven: 7the light becomes full in her : on the fourteenth day she
accomplishes her light. And fifteen parts of light are transferred to her till the
fifteenth day (when) her light is accomplished, according to the sign of the year, and she
becomes fifteen parts, and the moon grows by (the addition of) fourteenth <b>8</b> parts.
And in her waning (the moon) decreases on the first day to fourteen parts of her light, on
the second to thirteen parts of light, on the third to twelve, on the fourth to eleven, on
the fifth to ten, on the sixth to nine, on the seventh to eight, on the eighth to seven,
on the ninth to six, on the tenth to five, on the eleventh to four, on the twelfth to
three, on the thirteenth to two, on the <b>9</b> fourteenth to the half of a seventh, and
all her remaining light disappears wholly on the fifteenth. And <b>10</b> in certain
months the month has twenty-nine days and once twenty-eight. And Uriel showed me another
law: when light is transferred to the moon, and on which side it is transferred to her by
the sun. During all the period during which the moon is growing in her light, she is
transferring it to herself when opposite to the sun during fourteen daysher light is
accomplished in the heaven, <b>12</b> and when she is illumined throughout, her light is
accomplished full in the heaven. And on the first <b>13</b> day she is called the new
moon, for on that day the light rises upon her. She becomes full moon exactly on the day
when the sun sets in the west, and from the east she rises at night, and the moon shines
the whole night through till the sun rises over against her and the moon is seen over
against the sun. On the side whence the light of the moon comes forth, there again she
wanes till all the light vanishes and all the days of the month are at an end, and her
circumference is empty, void of <b>5</b> light. And three months she makes of thirty days,
and at her time she makes three months of twenty- nine days each, in which she
accomplishes her waning in the first period of time, and in the first <b>6</b> portal for
one hundred and seventy-seven days. And in the time of her going out she appears for three
months (of) thirty days each, and for three months she appears (of) twenty-nine each. At
night she appears like a man for twenty days each time, and by day she appears like the
heaven, and there is nothing else in her save her light.</p>

</b><p><b>1</b> And now, my son, I have shown thee everything, and the law of all the stars of
the heaven is <b>2</b> completed. And he showed me all the laws of these for every day,

the order prescribed to it every month <b>3</b> and every week: And the waning of the moon
which takes place in the sixth portal: for in this <b>4</b> sixth portal her light is

takes place in the first portal in its season, till one hundred and seventy-seven <b>5</b>

falls behind the sun and the order of the stars exactly five days in the course of one
period, and when <b>6</b> this place which thou seest has been traversed. Such is the

Creator. One year we will leave thee with thy son, till thou givest thy (last) commands,

</b><p><b>4</b> Blessed are all the righteous, blessed are all those who walk In the way of
righteousness and sin not as the sinners, in the reckoning of all their days in which the
sun traverses the heaven, entering into and departing from the portals for thirty days
with the heads of thousands of the order of the stars, together with the four which are
intercalated which divide the four portions of the year, which <b>5</b> lead them and
enter with them four days. Owing to them men shall be at fault and not reckon them in the
whole reckoning of the year: yea, men shall be at fault, and not recognize them <b>6</b>
accurately. For they belong to the reckoning of the year and are truly recorded (thereon)
for ever, one in the first portal and one in the third, and one in the fourth and one in
the sixth, and the year is completed in three hundred and sixty-four days. <b>7</b> And
the account thereof is accurate and the recorded reckoning thereof exact; for the
luminaries, and months and festivals, and years and days, has Uriel shown and revealed to
me, to whom the <b>8</b> Lord of the whole creation of the world hath subjected the host
of heaven. And he has power over night and day in the heaven to cause the light to give
light to men -sun, moon, and stars, <b>9</b> and all the powers of the heaven which
revolve in their circular chariots. And these are the orders of the stars, which set in
their places, and in their seasons and festivals and months. <b>10</b> And these are the
names of those who lead them, who watch that they enter at their times, in their orders,
in their seasons, in their months, in their periods of dominion, and in their positions.
Their four leaders who divide the four parts of the year enter first; and after them the
twelve leaders of the orders who divide the months; and for the three hundred and sixty
(days) there are heads over thousands who divide the days; and for the four intercalary
days there are the leaders which sunder <b>12</b> the four parts of the year. And these
heads over thousands are intercalated between <b>13</b> leader and leader, each behind a
station, but their leaders make the division. And these are the names of the leaders who
divide the four parts of the year which are ordained: Milkiel, Helemmelek, and Melejal, <b>14</b>
and Narel. And the names of those who lead them: Adnarel, and Ijasusael, and Elomeel-
these three follow the leaders of the orders, and there is one that follows the three
leaders of the orders which follow those leaders of stations that divide the four parts of
the year. In the beginning of the year Melkejal rises first and rules, who is named
Tamaini and sun, and <b>16</b> all the days of his dominion whilst he bears rule are
ninety-one days. And these are the signs of the days which are to be seen on earth in the
days of his dominion: sweat, and heat, and calms; and all the trees bear fruit, and leaves
are produced on all the trees, and the harvest of wheat, and the rose-flowers, and all the
flowers which come forth in the field, but the trees of the winter season become withered.
And these are the names of the leaders which are under them: Berkael, Zelebsel, and
another who is added a head of a thousand, called Hilujaseph: and the days of the dominion
of this (leader) are at an end. <b>18</b> The next leader after him is Helemmelek, whom
one names the shining sun, and all the days <b>19</b> of his light are ninety-one days.
And these are the signs of (his) days on the earth: glowing heat and dryness, and the
trees ripen their fruits and produce all their fruits ripe and ready, and the sheep pair
and become pregnant, and all the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and everything that
is <b>20</b> in the fields, and the winepress: these things take place in the days of his
dominion. These are the names, and the orders, and the leaders of those heads of
thousands: Gidaljal, Keel, and Heel, and the name of the head of a thousand which is added
to them, Asfael: and the days of his dominion are at an end.</p>

<h3>Chapter 83</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And now, my son Methuselah, I will show thee all my visions which I have seen,
recounting <b>2</b> them before thee. Two visions I saw before I took a wife, and the one
was quite unlike the other: the first when I was learning to write: the second before I
took thy mother, (when) I saw a terrible <b>3</b> vision. And regarding them I prayed to
the Lord. I had laid me down in the house of my grandfather Mahalalel, (when) I saw in a
vision how the heaven collapsed and was borne off and fell to <b>4</b> the earth. And when
it fell to the earth I saw how the earth was swallowed up in a great abyss, and mountains
were suspended on mountains, and hills sank down on hills, and high trees were rent <b>5</b>
from their stems, and hurled down and sunk in the abyss. And thereupon a word fell into my
mouth, <b>6</b> and I lifted up (my voice) to cry aloud, and said: The earth is destroyed.
And my grandfather Mahalalel waked me as I lay near him, and said unto me: Why dost thou
cry so, my son, and why <b>7</b> dost thou make such lamentation? And I recounted to him
the whole vision which I had seen, and he said unto me: A terrible thing hast thou seen,
my son, and of grave moment is thy dream- vision as to the secrets of all the sin of the
earth: it must sink into the abyss and be destroyed with <b>8</b> a great destruction. And
now, my son, arise and make petition to the Lord of glory, since thou art a believer, that
a remnant may remain on the earth, and that He may not destroy the whole <b>9</b> earth.
My son, from heaven all this will come upon the earth, and upon the earth there will be
great <b>10</b> destruction. After that I arose and prayed and implored and besought, and
wrote down my prayer for the generations of the world, and I will show everything to thee,
my son Methuselah. And when I had gone forth below and seen the heaven, and the sun rising
in the east, and the moon setting in the west, and a few stars, and the whole earth, and
everything as He had known it in the beginning, then I blessed the Lord of judgement and
extolled Him because He had made the sun to go forth from the windows of the east, and he
ascended and rose on the face of the heaven, and set out and kept traversing the path
shown unto him.</p>

<p>1,2 And after this I saw another dream, and I will show the whole dream to thee, my
son. And Enoch lifted up (his voice) and spake to his son Methuselah: To thee, my son,
will I speak: hear my words-incline thine ear to the dream-vision of thy father. Before I
took thy mother Edna, I saw in a vision on my bed, and behold a bull came forth from the
earth, and that bull was white; and after it came forth a heifer, and along with this
(latter) came forth two bulls, one of them black and <b>4</b> the other red. And that
black bull gored the red one and pursued him over the earth, and thereupon <b>5</b> I
could no longer see that red bull. But that black bull grew and that heifer went with him,
and <b>6</b> I saw that many oxen proceeded from him which resembled and followed him. And
that cow, that first one, went from the presence of that first bull in order to seek that
red one, but found him <b>7</b> not, and lamented with a great lamentation over him and
sought him. And I looked till that first <b>8</b> bull came to her and quieted her, and
from that time onward she cried no more. And after that she bore another white bull, and
after him she bore many bulls and black cows. <b>9</b> And I saw in my sleep that white
bull likewise grow and become a great white bull, and from Him proceeded many white bulls,
and they resembled him. And they began to beget many white bulls, which resembled them,
one following the other, (even) many.</p>

</b><p><b>1</b> And again I saw with mine eyes as I slept, and I saw the heaven above, and behold
a star fell <b>2</b> from heaven, and it arose and eat and pastured amongst those oxen.
And after that I saw the large and the black oxen, and behold they all changed their
stalls and pastures and their cattle, and began <b>3</b> to live with each other. And
again I saw in the vision, and looked towards the heaven, and behold I saw many stars
descend and cast themselves down from heaven to that first star, and they became <b>4</b>
bulls amongst those cattle and pastured with themamongst them </p>

<p>. And I looked at them and saw, and behold they all let out their privy members, like
horses, and began to cover the cows of the oxen, <b>5</b> and they all became pregnant and
bare elephants, camels, and asses. And all the oxen feared them and were affrighted at
them, and began to bite with their teeth and to devour, and to gore with their <b>6</b>
horns. And they began, moreover, to devour those oxen; and behold all the children of the
earth began to tremble and quake before them and to flee from them.</p>

<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And again I saw how they began to gore each other and to devour each other, and
the earth <b>2</b> began to cry aloud. And I raised mine eyes again to heaven, and I saw
in the vision, and behold there came forth from heaven beings who were like white men: and
four went forth from that place <b>3</b> and three with them. And those three that had
last come forth grasped me by my hand and took me up, away from the generations of the
earth, and raised me up to a lofty place, and showed me <b>4</b> a tower raised high above
the earth, and all the hills were lower. And one said unto me: Remain here till thou seest
everything that befalls those elephants, camels, and asses, and the stars and the oxen,
and all of them.</p>

<h3>Chapter 88</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I saw one of those four who had come forth first, and he seized that first
star which had fallen from the heaven, and bound it hand and foot and cast it into an
abyss: now that abyss was <b>2</b> narrow and deep, and horrible and dark. And one of them
drew a sword, and gave it to those elephants and camels and asses: then they began to
smite each other, and the whole earth quaked <b>3</b> because of them. And as I was
beholding in the vision, lo, one of those four who had come forth stoned (them) from
heaven, and gathered and took all the great stars whose privy members were like those of
horses, and bound them all hand and foot, and cast them in an abyss of the earth.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 89</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And one of those four went to that white bull and instructed him in a secret,
without his being terrified: he was born a bull and became a man, and built for himself a
great vessel and dwelt thereon; <b>2</b> and three bulls dwelt with him in that vessel and
they were covered in. And again I raised mine eyes towards heaven and saw a lofty roof,
with seven water torrents thereon, and those torrents <b>3</b> flowed with much water into
an enclosure. And I saw again, and behold fountains were opened on the surface of that
great enclosure, and that water began to swell and rise upon the surface, <b>4</b> and I
saw that enclosure till all its surface was covered with water. And the water, the
darkness, and mist increased upon it; and as I looked at the height of that water, that
water had risen above the height of that enclosure, and was streaming over that enclosure,
and it stood upon the earth. <b>5</b> And all the cattle of that enclosure were gathered
together until I saw how they sank and were 6 swallowed up and perished in that water. But
that vessel floated on the water, while all the oxen and elephants and camels and asses
sank to the bottom with all the animals, so that I could no longer see them, and they were
not able to escape, (but) perished and sank into the depths. And again I saw in the vision
till those water torrents were removed from that high roof, and the chasms <b>8</b> of the
earth were leveled up and other abysses were opened. Then the water began to run down into
these, till the earth became visible; but that vessel settled on the earth, and the
darkness <b>9</b> retired and light appeared. But that white bull which had become a man
came out of that vessel, and the three bulls with him, and one of those three was white
like that bull, and one of them was red as blood, and one black: and that white bull
departed from them. <b>10</b> And they began to bring forth beasts of the field and birds,
so that there arose different genera: lions, tigers, wolves, dogs, hyenas, wild boars,
foxes, squirrels, swine, falcons, vultures, kites, eagles, and ravens; and among them was
born a white bull. And they began to bite one another; but that white bull which was born
amongst them begat a wild ass and a white bull with it, and the <b>12</b> wild asses
multiplied. But that bull which was born from him begat a black wild boar and a white 13
sheep; and the former begat many boars, but that sheep begat twelve sheep. And when those
twelve sheep had grown, they gave up one of them to the asses, and those asses again gave
up that sheep to the wolves, and that sheep grew up among the wolves. And the Lord brought
the eleven sheep to live with it and to pasture with it among the wolves: and they
multiplied and became many flocks of sheep. And the wolves began to fear them, and they
oppressed them until they destroyed their little ones, and they cast their young into a
river of much water: but those sheep began to <b>16</b> cry aloud on account of their
little ones, and to complain unto their Lord. And a sheep which had been saved from the
wolves fled and escaped to the wild asses; and I saw the sheep how they lamented and
cried, and besought their Lord with all their might, till that Lord of the sheep descended
at the voice of the sheep from a lofty abode, and came to them and pastured them. And He
called that sheep which had escaped the wolves, and spake with it concerning the wolves
that it should <b>18</b> admonish them not to touch the sheep. And the sheep went to the
wolves according to the word of the Lord, and another sheep met it and went with it, and
the two went and entered together into the assembly of those wolves, and spake with them
and admonished them not to touch the <b>19</b> sheep from henceforth. And thereupon I saw
the wolves, and how they oppressed the sheep <b>20</b> exceedingly with all their power;
and the sheep cried aloud. And the Lord came to the sheep and they began to smite those
wolves: and the wolves began to make lamentation; but the sheep became <b>21</b> quiet and
forthwith ceased to cry out. And I saw the sheep till they departed from amongst the
wolves; but the eyes of the wolves were blinded, and those wolves departed in pursuit of
the sheep 22 with all their power. And the Lord of the sheep went with them, as their
leader, and all His sheep <b>23</b> followed Him: and his face was dazzling and glorious
and terrible to behold. But the wolves <b>24</b> began to pursue those sheep till they
reached a sea of water. And that sea was divided, and the water stood on this side and on
that before their face, and their Lord led them and placed Himself between <b>25</b> them
and the wolves. And as those wolves did not yet see the sheep, they proceeded into the
midst of that sea, and the wolves followed the sheep, andthose wolves </p>

<p>ran after them into that sea. <b>26</b> And when they saw the Lord of the sheep, they
turned to flee before His face, but that sea gathered itself together, and became as it
had been created, and the water swelled and rose till it covered <b>27</b> those wolves.
And I saw till all the wolves who pursued those sheep perished and were drowned. <b>28</b>
But the sheep escaped from that water and went forth into a wilderness, where there was no
water and no grass; and they began to open their eyes and to see; and I saw the Lord of
the sheep <b>29</b> pasturing them and giving them water and grass, and that sheep going
and leading them. And that <b>30</b> sheep ascended to the summit of that lofty rock, and
the Lord of the sheep sent it to them. And after that I saw the Lord of the sheep who
stood before them, and His appearance was great and <b>31</b> terrible and majestic, and
all those sheep saw Him and were afraid before His face. And they all feared and trembled
because of Him, and they cried to that sheep with themwhich was amongst <b>32</b> them </p>

<p>: We are not able to stand before our Lord or to behold Him. And that sheep which led
them again ascended to the summit of that rock, but the sheep began to be blinded and to
wander <b>33</b> from the way which he had showed them, but that sheep wot not thereof.
And the Lord of the sheep was wrathful exceedingly against them, and that sheep discovered
it, and went down from the summit of the rock, and came to the sheep, and found the
greatest part of them blinded and fallen <b>34</b> away. And when they saw it they feared
and trembled at its presence, and desired to return to their <b>35</b> folds. And that
sheep took other sheep with it, and came to those sheep which had fallen away, and began
to slay them; and the sheep feared its presence, and thus that sheep brought back those <b>36</b>
sheep that had fallen away, and they returned to their folds. And I saw in this vision
till that sheep became a man and built a house for the Lord of the sheep, and placed all
the sheep in that house. <b>37</b> And I saw till this sheep which had met that sheep
which led them fell asleep: and I saw till all the great sheep perished and little ones
arose in their place, and they came to a pasture, and <b>38</b> approached a stream of
water. Then that sheep, their leader which had become a man, withdrew <b>39</b> from them
and fell asleep, and all the sheep sought it and cried over it with a great crying. And I
saw till they left off crying for that sheep and crossed that stream of water, and there
arose the two sheep as leaders in the place of those which had led them and fallen asleep
(lit. had fallen asleep and led <b>40</b> them ). And I saw till the sheep came to a
goodly place, and a pleasant and glorious land, and I saw till those sheep were satisfied;
and that house stood amongst them in the pleasant land. <b>41</b> And sometimes their eyes
were opened, and sometimes blinded, till another sheep arose and led them and brought them
all back, and their eyes were opened. <b>42</b> And the dogs and the foxes and the wild
boars began to devour those sheep till the Lord of the sheep raised up another sheep </p>

<p>a ram from their <b>43</b> midst, which led them. And that ram began to butt on either
side those dogs, foxes, and wild <b>44</b> boars till he had destroyed them all. And that
sheep whose eyes were opened saw that ram, which was amongst the sheep, till it forsook
its glory and began to butt those sheep, and trampled upon them, and behaved itself 45
unseemly. And the Lord of the sheep sent the lamb to another lamb and raised it to being a
ram and leader of the sheep instead of that <b>46</b> ram which had forsaken its glory.
And it went to it and spake to it alone, and raised it to being a ram, and made it the
prince and leader of the sheep; but during all these things those dogs <b>47</b> oppressed
the sheep. And the first ram pursued that second ram, and that second ram arose and fled
before it; and I saw till those dogs pulled <b>48</b> down the first ram. And that second
ram arose <b>49</b> and led the little sheep. And those sheep grew and multiplied; but all
the dogs, and foxes, and wild boars feared and fled before it, and that ram butted and
killed the wild beasts, and those wild beasts had no longer any power among the 48b sheep
and robbed them no more of ought. And that ram begat many sheep and fell asleep; and a
little sheep became ram in its stead, and became prince and leader of those sheep. <b>50</b>
And that house became great and broad, and it was built for those sheep: (and) a tower
lofty and great was built on the house for the Lord of the sheep, and that house was low,
but the tower was elevated and lofty, and the Lord of the sheep stood on that tower and
they offered a full table before Him. <b>51</b> And again I saw those sheep that they
again erred and went many ways, and forsook that their house, and the Lord of the sheep
called some from amongst the sheep and sent them to the sheep, <b>52</b> but the sheep
began to slay them. And one of them was saved and was not slain, and it sped away and
cried aloud over the sheep; and they sought to slay it, but the Lord of the sheep saved it
from <b>53</b> the sheep, and brought it up to me, and caused it to dwell there. And many
other sheep He sent to those sheep to testify unto them and lament over them. And after
that I saw that when they forsook the house of the Lord and His tower they fell away
entirely, and their eyes were blinded; and I saw the Lord of the sheep how He wrought much
slaughter amongst them in their herds until <b>55</b> those sheep invited that slaughter
and betrayed His place. And He gave them over into the hands of the lions and tigers, and
wolves and hyenas, and into the hand of the foxes, and to all the wild <b>56</b> beasts,
and those wild beasts began to tear in pieces those sheep. And I saw that He forsook that
their house and their tower and gave them all into the hand of the lions, to tear and
devour them, <b>57</b> into the hand of all the wild beasts. And I began to cry aloud with
all my power, and to appeal to the Lord of the sheep, and to represent to Him in regard to
the sheep that they were devoured <b>58</b> by all the wild beasts. But He remained
unmoved, though He saw it, and rejoiced that they were devoured and swallowed and robbed,
and left them to be devoured in the hand of all the beasts. <b>59</b> And He called
seventy shepherds, and cast those sheep to them that they might pasture them, and He spake
to the shepherds and their companions: Let each individual of you pasture the sheep <b>60</b>
henceforward, and everything that I shall command you that do ye. And I will deliver them
over unto you duly numbered, and tell you which of them are to be destroyed-and them
destroy ye. And <b>61</b> He gave over unto them those sheep. And He called another and
spake unto him: Observe and mark everything that the shepherds will do to those sheep; for
they will destroy more of them than <b>62</b> I have commanded them. And every excess and
the destruction which will be wrought through the shepherds, record (namely) how many they
destroy according to my command, and how many according to their own caprice: record
against every individual shepherd all the destruction he <b>63</b> effects. And read out
before me by number how many they destroy, and how many they deliver over for destruction,
that I may have this as a testimony against them, and know every deed of the shepherds,
that I may comprehend and see what they do, whether or not they abide by my <b>64</b>
command which I have commanded them. But they shall not know it, and thou shalt not
declare it to them, nor admonish them, but only record against each individual all the
destruction which <b>65</b> the shepherds effect each in his time and lay it all before
me. And I saw till those shepherds pastured in their season, and they began to slay and to
destroy more than they were bidden, and they delivered <b>66</b> those sheep into the hand
of the lions. And the lions and tigers eat and devoured the greater part of those sheep,
and the wild boars eat along with them; and they burnt that tower and demolished <b>67</b>
that house. And I became exceedingly sorrowful over that tower because that house of the
sheep was demolished, and afterwards I was unable to see if those sheep entered that
house. <b>68</b> And the shepherds and their associates delivered over those sheep to all
the wild beasts, to devour them, and each one of them received in his time a definite
number: it was written by the other <b>69</b> in a book how many each one of them
destroyed of them. And each one slew and destroyed many <b>70</b> more than was
prescribed; and I began to weep and lament on account of those sheep. And thus in the
vision I saw that one who wrote, how he wrote down every one that was destroyed by those
shepherds, day by day, and carried up and laid down and showed actually the whole book to
the Lord of the sheep-(even) everything that they had done, and all that each one of them
had made <b>71</b> away with, and all that they had given over to destruction. And the
book was read before the Lord of the sheep, and He took the book from his hand and read it
and sealed it and laid it down. <b>72</b> And forthwith I saw how the shepherds pastured
for twelve hours, and behold three of those sheep turned back and came and entered and
began to build up all that had fallen down of that <b>73</b> house; but the wild boars
tried to hinder them, but they were not able. And they began again to build as before, and
they reared up that tower, and it was named the high tower; and they began again to place
a table before the tower, but all the bread on it was polluted and not pure. <b>74</b> And
as touching all this the eyes of those sheep were blinded so that they saw not, and (the
eyes of) their shepherds likewise; and they delivered them in large numbers to their
shepherds for <b>75</b> destruction, and they trampled the sheep with their feet and
devoured them. And the Lord of the sheep remained unmoved till all the sheep were
dispersed over the field and mingled with them (i.e. the <b>76</b> beasts), and they (i.e.
the shepherds) did not save them out of the hand of the beasts. And this one who wrote the
book carried it up, and showed it and read it before the Lord of the sheep, and implored
Him on their account, and besought Him on their account as he showed Him all the doings <b>77</b>
of the shepherds, and gave testimony before Him against all the shepherds. And he took the
actual book and laid it down beside Him and departed.</p>

<h3>Chapter 90</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I saw till that in this manner thirty-five shepherds undertook the pasturing
(of the sheep), and they severally completed their periods as did the first; and others
received them into their <b>2</b> hands, to pasture them for their period, each shepherd
in his own period. And after that I saw in my vision all the birds of heaven coming, the
eagles, the vultures, the kites, the ravens; but the eagles led all the birds; and they
began to devour those sheep, and to pick out their eyes and to <b>3</b> devour their
flesh. And the sheep cried out because their flesh was being devoured by the birds, <b>4</b>
and as for me I looked and lamented in my sleep over that shepherd who pastured the sheep.
And I saw until those sheep were devoured by the dogs and eagles and kites, and they left
neither flesh nor skin nor sinew remaining on them till only their bones stood there: and
their bones too fell <b>5</b> to the earth and the sheep became few. And I saw until that
twenty-three had undertaken the pasturing and completed in their several periods
fifty-eight times. <b>6</b> But behold lambs were borne by those white sheep, and they
began to open their eyes and to see, <b>7</b> and to cry to the sheep. Yea, they cried to
them, but they did not hearken to what they said to 8 them, but were exceedingly deaf, and
their eyes were very exceedingly blinded. And I saw in the vision how the ravens flew upon
those lambs and took one of those lambs, and dashed the sheep <b>9</b> in pieces and
devoured them. And I saw till horns grew upon those lambs, and the ravens cast down their
horns; and I saw till there sprouted a great horn of one of those sheep, and their eyes <b>10</b>
were opened. And it looked at themand their eyes opened </p>

<p>, and it cried to the sheep, and the <b>11</b> rams saw it and all ran to it. And
notwithstanding all this those eagles and vultures and ravens and kites still kept tearing
the sheep and swooping down upon them and devouring them: still the sheep remained silent,
but the rams lamented and cried out. And those ravens fought and battled with it and
sought to lay low its horn, but they had no power over it. All the eagles and vultures and
ravens and kites were gathered together, and there came with them all the sheep of the
field, yea, they all came together, and helped each other to break that horn of the ram.
19 And I saw till a great sword was given to the sheep, and the sheep proceeded against
all the beasts of the field to slay them, and all the beasts and the birds of the heaven
fled before their face. And I saw that man, who wrote the book according to the command of
the Lord, till he opened that book concerning the destruction which those twelve last
shepherds had wrought, and showed that they had destroyed much more than their
predecessors, before the Lord of the sheep. And I saw till the Lord of the sheep came unto
them and took in His hand the staff of His wrath, and smote the earth, and the earth clave
asunder, and all the beasts and all the birds of the heaven fell from among those sheep,
and were swallowed up in the earth and it covered them. <b>20</b> And I saw till a throne
was erected in the pleasant land, and the Lord of the sheep sat Himself thereon, and the
other took the sealed books and opened those books before the Lord of the sheep. 21 And
the Lord called those men the seven first white ones, and commanded that they should bring
before Him, beginning with the first star which led the way, all the stars whose privy
members <b>22</b> were like those of horses, and they brought them all before Him. And He
said to that man who wrote before Him, being one of those seven white ones, and said unto
him: Take those seventy shepherds to whom I delivered the sheep, and who taking them on
their own authority slew more <b>23</b> than I commanded them. And behold they were all
bound, I saw, and they all stood before Him. <b>24</b> And the judgement was held first
over the stars, and they were judged and found guilty, and went to the place of
condemnation, and they were cast into an abyss, full of fire and flaming, and full <b>25</b>
of pillars of fire. And those seventy shepherds were judged and found guilty, and they
were cast <b>26</b> into that fiery abyss. And I saw at that time how a like abyss was
opened in the midst of the earth, full of fire, and they brought those blinded sheep, and
they were all judged and found guilty and <b>27</b> cast into this fiery abyss, and they
burned; now this abyss was to the right of that house. And I saw those sheep burning and
their bones burning. <b>28</b> And I stood up to see till they folded up that old house;
and carried off all the pillars, and all the beams and ornaments of the house were at the
same time folded up with it, and they carried <b>29</b> it off and laid it in a place in
the south of the land. And I saw till the Lord of the sheep brought a new house greater
and loftier than that first, and set it up in the place of the first which had beer folded
up: all its pillars were new, and its ornaments were new and larger than those of the
first, the old one which He had taken away, and all the sheep were within it. <b>30</b>
And I saw all the sheep which had been left, and all the beasts on the earth, and all the
birds of the heaven, falling down and doing homage to those sheep and making petition to
and obeying <b>31</b> them in every thing. And thereafter those three who were clothed in
white and had seized me by my handwho had taken me up before </p>

<p>, and the hand of that ram also seizing hold of me, they <b>32</b> took me up and set
me down in the midst of those sheep before the judgement took place. And those <b>33</b>
sheep were all white, and their wool was abundant and clean. And all that had been
destroyed and dispersed, and all the beasts of the field, and all the birds of the heaven,
assembled in that house, and the Lord of the sheep rejoiced with great joy because they
were all good and had returned to <b>34</b> His house. And I saw till they laid down that
sword, which had been given to the sheep, and they brought it back into the house, and it
was sealed before the presence of the Lord, and all the sheep <b>35</b> were invited into
that house, but it held them not. And the eyes of them all were opened, and they <b>36</b>
saw the good, and there was not one among them that did not see. And I saw that that house
was large and broad and very full. <b>37</b> And I saw that a white bull was born, with
large horns and all the beasts of the field and all the <b>38</b> birds of the air feared
him and made petition to him all the time. And I saw till all their generations were
transformed, and they all became white bulls; and the first among them became a lamb, and
that lamb became a great animal and had great black horns on its head; and the Lord of the
sheep <b>39</b> rejoiced over it and over all the oxen. And I slept in their midst: and I
awoke and saw everything. <b>40</b> This is the vision which I saw while I slept, and I
awoke and blessed the Lord of righteousness and <b>41</b> gave Him glory. Then I wept with
a great weeping and my tears stayed not till I could no longer endure it: when I saw, they
flowed on account of what I had seen; for everything shall come and <b>42</b> be
fulfilled, and all the deeds of men in their order were shown to me. On that night I
remembered the first dream, and because of it I wept and was troubled-because I had seen
that vision.</p>

</b><p><b>1</b>,<b>2</b> And after that Enoch both gave and began to recount from the books. And
Enoch said: </p>

<p>Concerning the children of righteousness and concerning the elect of the world,<br>
And concerning the plant of uprightness, I will speak these things,<br>
Yea, I Enoch will declare (them) unto you, my sons: </p>

<p>According to that which appeared to me in the heavenly vision,<br>
And which I have known through the word of the holy angels,<br>
And have learnt from the heavenly tablets. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And Enoch began to recount from the books and said:<br>
I was born the seventh in the first week,<br>
While judgement and righteousness still endured. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> And after me there shall arise in the second week great wickedness,<br>
And deceit shall have sprung up;<br>
And in it there shall be the first end. </p>

<p>And in it a man shall be saved;<br>
And after it is ended unrighteousness shall grow up,<br>
And a law shall be made for the sinners. </p>

<p>And after that in the third week at its close<br>
A man shall be elected as the plant of righteous judgement,<br>
And his posterity shall become the plant of righteousness for evermore. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And after that in the fourth week, at its close,<br>
Visions of the holy and righteous shall be seen,<br>
And a law for all generations and an enclosure shall be made for them. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> And after that in the fifth week, at its close,<br>
The house of glory and dominion shall be built for ever. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>8</b> And after that in the sixth week all who live in it shall be blinded,<br>
And the hearts of all of them shall godlessly forsake wisdom. </p>

<p>And in it a man shall ascend;<br>
And at its close the house of dominion shall be burnt with fire,<br>
And the whole race of the chosen root shall be dispersed. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> And after that in the seventh week shall an apostate generation arise,<br>
And many shall be its deeds,<br>
And all its deeds shall be apostate. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>10</b> And at its close shall be elected<br>
The elect righteous of the eternal plant of righteousness,<br>
To receive sevenfold instruction concerning all His creation. </p>

<p>11For who is there of all the children of men that is able to hear the voice of the
Holy One without being troubled ? And who can think His thoughts ? and who is there that
can behold all the works <b>12</b> of heaven ? And how should there be one who could
behold the heaven, and who is there that could understand the things of heaven and see a
soul or a spirit and could tell thereof, or ascend and see <b>13</b> all their ends and
think them or do like them ? And who is there of all men that could know what is the
breadth and the length of the earth, and to whom has been shown the measure of all of them
? <b>14</b> Or is there any one who could discern the length of the heaven and how great
is its height, and upon what it is founded, and how great is the number of the stars, and
where all the luminaries rest ?</p>

</b><p><b>1</b> And now I say unto you, my sons, love righteousness and walk therein;<br>
For the paths of righteousness are worthy of acceptation,<br>
But the paths of unrighteousness shall suddenly be destroyed and vanish. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> And to certain men of a generation shall the paths of violence and of death be
revealed,<br>
And they shall hold themselves afar from them,<br>
And shall not follow them. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And now I say unto you the righteous:<br>
Walk not in the paths of wickedness, nor in the paths of death,<br>
And draw not nigh to them, lest ye be destroyed. </p>
<b>

And walk in the paths of peace,<br>
And ye shall live and prosper. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> And hold fast my words in the thoughts of your hearts,<br>
And suffer them not to be effaced from your hearts; </p>

<p>For I know that sinners will tempt men to evilly-entreat wisdom,<br>
So that no place may be found for her,<br>
And no manner of temptation may minish. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> Woe to those who build unrighteousness and oppression<br>
And lay deceit as a foundation;<br>
For they shall be suddenly overthrown,<br>
And they shall have no peace. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> Woe to those who build their houses with sin;<br>
For from all their foundations shall they be overthrown,<br>

And from your riches shall ye depart,<br>
Because ye have not remembered the Most High in the days of your riches. </p>

And have become ready for the day of slaughter,<br>
And the day of darkness and the day of the great judgement. </p>

</b><p><b>10</b> Thus I speak and declare unto you:<br>
He who hath created you will overthrow you,<br>
And for your fall there shall be no compassion,<br>

And higher than the vultures will be your nest,<br>
And ye shall ascend and enter the crevices of the earth,<br>

<h3>Chapter 98</h3>

</b><p><b>1</b> And now I swear unto you, to the wise and to the foolish,<br>
For ye shall have manifold experiences on the earth. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> For ye men shall put on more adornments than a woman,<br>
And coloured garments more than a virgin:<br>
In royalty and in grandeur and in power,<br>
And in silver and in gold and in purple,<br>
And in splendour and in food they shall be poured out as water. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> Therefore they shall be wanting in doctrine and wisdom,<br>
And they shall perish thereby together with their possessions;<br>
And with all their glory and their splendour,<br>
And in shame and in slaughter and in great destitution,<br>
Their spirits shall be cast into the furnace of fire. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> I have sworn unto you, ye sinners, as a mountain has not become a slave,<br>
And a hill does not become the handmaid of a woman,<br>
Even so sin has not been sent upon the earth,<br>
But man of himself has created it,<br>
And under a great curse shall they fall who commit it. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> And barrenness has not been given to the woman,<br>
But on account of the deeds of her own hands she dies without children. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> I have sworn unto you, ye sinners, by the Holy Great One,<br>
That all your evil deeds are revealed in the heavens,<br>
And that none of your deeds of oppression are covered and hidden. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> And do not think in your spirit nor say in your heart that ye do not know and
that ye do not see <b>8</b> that every sin is every day recorded in heaven in the presence

written down every day till the day of your judgement. <b>9</b> Woe to you, ye fools, for
through your folly shall ye perish: and ye transgress against the wise, <b>10</b> and so
good hap shall not be your portion. And now, know ye that ye are prepared for the day of
destruction: wherefore do not hope to live, ye sinners, but ye shall depart and die; for
ye know no ransom; for ye are prepared for the day of the great judgement, for the day of
tribulation and great shame for your spirits. <b>11</b> Woe to you, ye obstinate of heart,
who work wickedness and eat blood: Whence have ye good things to eat and to drink and to
be filled ? From all the good things which the Lord the Most High has placed in abundance
on the earth; therefore ye shall have no peace. <b>12</b> Woe to you who love the deeds of
unrighteousness: wherefore do ye hope for good hap unto yourselves? know that ye shall be
delivered into the hands of the righteous, and they shall cut <b>3</b> off your necks and
slay you, and have no mercy upon you. Woe to you who rejoice in the tribulation of the
righteous; for no grave shall be dug for you. Woe to you who set at nought the words of <b>5</b>
the righteous; for ye shall have no hope of life. Woe to you who write down lying and
godless words; for they write down their lies that men may hear them and act godlessly
towards (their) <b>6</b> neighbour. Therefore they shall have no peace but die a sudden
death.</p>
</font>

<h3>Chapter 99</h3>

And transgress the eternal law,<br>
And transform themselves into what they were notinto sinners </p>

<p>:<br>
They shall be trodden under foot upon the earth. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> In those days make ready, ye righteous, to raise your prayers as a memorial,<br>
And place them as a testimony before the angels,<br>
That they may place the sin of the sinners for a memorial before the Most High. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>4</b> In those days the nations shall be stirred up,<br>
And the families of the nations shall arise on the day of destruction. </p>

And they shall abandon them, so that their children shall perish through them:<br>
Yea, they shall abandon their children (that are still) sucklings, and not return to them,<br>
And shall have no pity on their beloved ones. </p>

<p>6, <b>7</b> And again I swear to you, ye sinners, that sin is prepared for a day of

And their eyes shall be blinded through the fear of their hearts<br>
And through visions in their dreams. </p>

For they shall have wrought all their work in a lie,<br>
And shall have worshiped a stone:<br>
Therefore in an instant shall they perish. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>10</b> But in those days blessed are all they who accept the words of wisdom, and
understand them,<br>
And observe the paths of the Most High, and walk in the path of His righteousness,<br>
And become not godless with the godless;<br>
For they shall be saved. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>11</b> Woe to you who spread evil to your neighbours;<br>
For you shall be slain in Sheol. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>12</b> Woe to you who make deceitful and false measures,<br>
And (to them) who cause bitterness on the earth;<br>
For they shall thereby be utterly consumed. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>13</b> Woe to you who build your houses through the grievous toil of others,<br>
And all their building materials are the bricks and stones of sin;<br>
I tell you ye shall have no peace. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>14</b> Woe to them who reject the measure and eternal heritage of their fathers<br>
And whose souls follow after idols;<br>
For they shall have no rest. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>15</b> Woe to them who work unrighteousness and help oppression,<br>
And slay their neighbours until the day of the great judgement. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>16</b> For He shall cast down your glory,<br>
And bring affliction on your hearts,<br>

And the sinner shall not withhold his hand from his honoured brother:<br>
From dawn till sunset they shall slay one another. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And the horse shall walk up to the breast in the blood of sinners,<br>
And the chariot shall be submerged to its height. </p>

</b><p><b>4</b> In those days the angels shall descend into the secret places<br>
And gather together into one place all those who brought down sin<br>
And the Most High will arise on that day of judgement<br>
To execute great judgement amongst sinners. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>5</b> And over all the righteous and holy He will appoint guardians from amongst the
holy angels<br>
To guard them as the apple of an eye,<br>
Until He makes an end of all wickedness and all sin,<br>
And though the righteous sleep a long sleep, they have nought to fear. </p>

</b><p><b>6</b> And (then) the children of the earth shall see the wise in security,<br>
And shall understand all the words of this book,<br>
And recognize that their riches shall not be able to save them<br>
In the overthrow of their sins. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>7</b> Woe to you, Sinners, on the day of strong anguish,<br>
Ye who afflict the righteous and burn them with fire:<br>
Ye shall be requited according to your works. </p>

Who watch in order to devise wickedness:<br>
Therefore shall fear come upon you<br>
And there shall be none to help you. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>9</b> Woe to you, ye sinners, on account of the words of your mouth,<br>
And on account of the deeds of your hands which your godlessness as wrought,<br>
In blazing flames burning worse than fire shall ye burn. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>10</b> And now, know ye that from the angels He will inquire as to your deeds in
heaven, from the sun and from the moon and from the stars in reference to your sins
because upon the earth ye execute <b>11</b> judgement on the righteous. And He will summon
to testify against you every cloud and mist and dew and rain; for they shall all be
withheld because of you from descending upon you, and they <b>12</b> shall be mindful of
your sins. And now give presents to the rain that it be not withheld from descending upon
you, nor yet the dew, when it has received gold and silver from you that it may descend.
When the hoar-frost and snow with their chilliness, and all the snow-storms with all their
plagues fall upon you, in those days ye shall not be able to stand before them.</p>

what will ye do then? And if He sends His anger upon you because of your deeds, ye cannot
petition Him; for ye spake proud and insolent <b>4</b> words against His righteousness:
therefore ye shall have no peace. And see ye not the sailors of the ships, how their ships
are tossed to and fro by the waves, and are shaken by the winds, and are <b>5</b> in sore
trouble ? And therefore do they fear because all their goodly possessions go upon the sea
with them, and they have evil forebodings of heart that the sea will swallow them and they
will <b>6</b> perish therein. Are not the entire sea and all its waters, and all its
movements, the work of the Most <b>7</b> High, and has He not set limits to its doings,
and confined it throughout by the sand ? And at His reproof it is afraid and dries up, and
all its fish die and all that is in it; But ye sinners that are <b>8</b> on the earth fear
Him not. Has He not made the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein ? Who has given
understanding and wisdom to everything that moves on the earth and in the sea. <b>9</b> Do
not the sailors of the ships fear the sea ? Yet sinners fear not the Most High.</p>

<b>

</b><p><b>2</b> And all the luminaries shall be affrighted with great fear,<br>
And all the earth shall be affrighted and tremble and be alarmed. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>3</b> And all the angels shall execute their commandst<br>
And shall seek to hide themselves from the presence of the Great Glory,<br>
And the children of earth shall tremble and quake;<br>

And be hopeful ye that have died in righteousness. </p>

And that in your life your body fared not according to your goodness,<br>
But wait for the day of the judgement of sinners<br>
And for the day of cursing and chastisement. </p>
<b>

</b><p><b>6</b> And yet when ye die the sinners speak over you:<br>
" As we die, so die the righteous,<br>
And what benefit do they reap for their deeds ? </p>

Behold, they too have died,<br>

strip men naked, and <b>10</b> acquire wealth and see good days. Have ye seen the
righteous how their end falls out, that no manner <b>11</b> of violence is found in them

We have toiled laboriously and had no satisfaction in our toil;<br>

and they concealed their oppression, and they did not remove from us the yoke of those

glory of the Great <b>2</b> One: and your names are written before the glory of the Great
One. Be hopeful; for aforetime ye were put to shame through ill and affliction; but now ye
shall shine as the lights of heaven, <b>3</b> ye shall shine and ye shall be seen, and the
portals of heaven shall be opened to you. And in your cry, cry for judgement, and it shall
appear to you; for all your tribulation shall be visited on the <b>4</b> rulers, and on
all who helped those who plundered you. Be hopeful, and cast not away your hopes for ye
shall have great joy as the angels of heaven. What shall ye be obliged to do ? Ye shall
not have to hide on the day of the great judgement and ye shall not be found as sinners,
and the eternal 6 judgement shall be far from you for all the generations of the world.
And now fear not, ye righteous, when ye see the sinners growing strong and prospering in
their ways: be not companions with them, <b>7</b> but keep afar from their violence; for
ye shall become companions of the hosts of heaven. And, although ye sinners say: "
All our sins shall not be searched out and be written down," nevertheless <b>8</b>
they shall write down all your sins every day. And now I show unto you that light and
darkness, <b>9</b> day and night, see all your sins. Be not godless in your hearts, and
lie not and alter not the words of uprightness, nor charge with lying the words of the
Holy Great One, nor take account of your <b>10</b> idols; for all your lying and all your
godlessness issue not in righteousness but in great sin. And now I know this mystery, that
sinners will alter and pervert the words of righteousness in many ways, and will speak
wicked words, and lie, and practice great deceits, and write books concerning <b>11</b>
their words. But when they write down truthfully all my words in their languages, and do
not change or minish ought from my words but write them all down truthfully -all that I
first testified <b>12</b> concerning them. Then, I know another mystery, that books will
be given to the righteous and the <b>13</b> wise to become a cause of joy and uprightness
and much wisdom. And to them shall the books be given, and they shall believe in them and
rejoice over them, and then shall all the righteous who have learnt therefrom all the
paths of uprightness be recompensed.</p>

</b><p><b>1</b> In those days the Lord bade (them) to summon and testify to the children of earth
concerning their wisdom: Show (it) unto them; for ye are their guides, and a recompense
over the whole earth. <b>2</b> For I and My son will be united with them for ever in the
paths of uprightness in their lives; and ye shall have peace: rejoice, ye children of
uprightness. Amen.</p>

<h3>Chapter 106</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And after some days my son Methuselah took a wife for his son Lamech, and she
became <b>2</b> pregnant by him and bore a son. And his body was white as snow and red as
the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as wool,
and his eyes beautiful. And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whole house like
the sun, and the whole house <b>3</b> was very bright. And thereupon he arose in the hands
of the midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of righteousness. <b>4</b>
And his father Lamech was afraid of him and <b>5</b> fled, and came to his father
Methuselah. And he said unto him: I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike
man, and resembling the sons of the God of heaven; and his nature is different and he is
not like us, and his eyes are as the rays of the sun, and his <b>6</b> countenance is
glorious. And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me but from the angels, and I fear
that in his days a wonder may be <b>7</b> wrought on the earth. And now, my father, I am
here to petition thee and implore thee that thou mayest go to Enoch, our father, and learn
from him the truth, for his dwelling-place is <b>8</b> amongst the angels. And when
Methuselah heard the words of his son, he came to me to the ends of the earth; for he had
heard that <b>1</b> was there, and he cried aloud, and I heard his voice and I came to
him. And <b>1</b> said unto him: Behold, here am I, my son, wherefore hast <b>9</b> thou
come to me ? And he answered and said: Because of a great cause of anxiety have I come to
thee, and because of a disturbing vision <b>10</b> have I approached. And now, my father,
hear me: unto Lamech my son there hath been born a son, the like of whom there is none,
and his nature is not like mans nature, and the colour of his body is whiter than snow and
redder than the bloom of a rose, and the hair of his head is whiter than white wool, and
his eyes are like the rays of the sun, and he opened his eyes and <b>11</b> thereupon
lighted up the whole house. And he arose in the hands of the midwife, and opened <b>12</b>
his mouth and blessed the Lord of heaven. And his father Lamech became afraid and fled to
me, and did not believe that he was sprung from him, but that he was in the likeness of
the angels of heaven; and behold I have come to thee that thou mayest make known to me the
truth. And I, Enoch, answered and said unto him: The Lord will do a new thing on the
earth, and this I have already seen in a vision, and make known to thee that in the
generation of my father Jared some of the angels of heaven transgressed the word of the
Lord. And behold they commit sin and transgress the law, and have united themselves with
women and commit sin with them, and have married some of them, and have begot children by
them. And they shall produce on the earth giants not according to the spirit, but
according to the flesh, and there shall be a great punishment on the earth, and the earth
shall be cleansed from all impurity. Yea, there shall come a great destruction over the
whole earth, and there shall be a deluge and <b>16</b> a great destruction for one year.
And this son who has been born unto you shall be left on the earth, and his three children
shall be saved with him: when all mankind that are on the earth <b>8</b> shall diehe and
his sons shall be saved </p>

<p>. And now make known to thy son Lamech that he who has been born is in truth his son,
and call his name Noah; for he shall be left to you, and he and his sons shall be saved
from the destruction, which shall come upon the earth on account of all the sin and all
the unrighteousness, which shall be consummated on the earth in his days. And after that
there shall be still more unrighteousness than that which was first consummated on the
earth; for I know the mysteries of the holy ones; for He, the Lord, has showed me and
informed me, and I have read (them) in the heavenly tablets.</p>

<h3>Chapter 107</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> And I saw written on them that generation upon generation shall transgress, till
a generation of righteousness arises, and transgression is destroyed and sin passes away
from the earth, and all <b>2</b> manner of good comes upon it. And now, my son, go and
make known to thy son Lamech that this <b>3</b> son, which has been born, is in truth his
son, and that (this) is no lie. And when Methuselah had heard the words of his father
Enoch-for he had shown to him everything in secret-he returned and showed (them) to him
and called the name of that son Noah; for he will comfort the earth after all the
destruction.</p>

<h3>Chapter 108</h3>
<font size="2"><b>

</b><p><b>1</b> Another book which Enoch wrote for his son Methuselah and for those who will come
after him, <b>2</b> and keep the law in the last days. Ye who have done good shall wait
for those days till an end is made of those who work evil; and an end of the might of the
transgressors. And wait ye indeed till sin has passed away, for their names shall be
blotted out of the book of life and out of the holy books, and their seed shall be
destroyed for ever, and their spirits shall be slain, and they shall cry and make
lamentation in a place that is a chaotic wilderness, and in the fire shall they burn; for
there is no earth there. And I saw there something like an invisible cloud; for by reason
of its depth I could not look over, and I saw a flame of fire blazing brightly, and things
like shining <b>5</b> mountains circling and sweeping to and fro. And I asked one of the
holy angels who was with me and said unto him: What is this shining thing? for it is not a
heaven but only the flame of a blazing <b>6</b> fire, and the voice of weeping and crying
and lamentation and strong pain. And he said unto me: This place which thou seest-here are
cast the spirits of sinners and blasphemers, and of those who work wickedness, and of
those who pervert everything that the Lord hath spoken through the mouth <b>7</b> of the
prophets-(even) the things that shall be. For some of them are written and inscribed above
in the heaven, in order that the angels may read them and know that which shall befall the
sinners, and the spirits of the humble, and of those who have afflicted their bodies, and
been recompensed <b>8</b> by God; and of those who have been put to shame by wicked men:
Who love God and loved neither gold nor silver nor any of the good things which are in the
world, but gave over their bodies to torture. Who, since they came into being, longed not
after earthly food, but regarded everything as a passing breath, and lived accordingly,
and the Lord tried them much, and their spirits were <b>10</b> found pure so that they
should bless His name. And all the blessings destined for them I have recounted in the
books. And he hath assigned them their recompense, because they have been found to be such
as loved heaven more than their life in the world, and though they were trodden under foot
of wicked men, and experienced abuse and reviling from them and were put to shame, <b>11</b>
yet they blessed Me. And now I will summon the spirits of the good who belong to the
generation of light, and I will transform those who were born in darkness, who in the
flesh were not recompensed <b>12</b> with such honour as their faithfulness deserved. And
I will bring forth in shining light those who 13 have loved My holy name, and I will seat
each on the throne of his honour. And they shall be resplendent for times without number;
for righteousness is the judgement of God; for to the faithful <b>14</b> He will give
faithfulness in the habitation of upright paths. And they shall see those who were , <b>15</b>
born in darkness led into darkness, while the righteous shall be resplendent. And the
sinners shall cry aloud and see them resplendent, and they indeed will go where days and
seasons are prescribed for them. </p>
