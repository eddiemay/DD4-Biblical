<p class="contents">
How <i>Solomon</i>, when he had received the kingdom, took off his enemies.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.1">1.</a> [About An. 1056.] <span class="smallcaps">We have</span> already treated of David, and his virtue; and of the benefits he was the author of to his countreymen; of his wars also, and battels which he managed with success, and then died an old man, in the foregoing book. And when Solomon his son, who was but a youth in age,<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#margin_note_1" id="b1"><sup>1</sup></a> had taken the Kingdom, and whom David had declared, while he was alive, the Lord of that people, according to God’s will: when he sat upon the throne, the whole body of the people made joyful acclamations to him: as is usual at the beginning of a reign: and wished that all his affairs might come to a blessed conclusion; and that he might arrive at a great age, and at the most happy state of affairs possible.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.2">2.</a> [About An. 1055.] <a id="page231">But</a> Adonijah, who while his father was living attempted to gain possession of the government, came to the King’s mother Bathsheba, and saluted her with great civility: and when she asked him, whether he came to her as desiring her assistance in any thing or not? and bid him tell her if that were the case, for that she would chearfully afford it him; he began to say, that “She knew her self that the Kingdom was his, both on account of his elder age, and of the disposition of the multitude; and that yet it was transferred to Solomon her son, according to the will of God. He also said, that he was contented to be a servant under him, and was pleased with the present settlement. But he desired her to be a means of obtaining a favour from his brother to him, and to persuade him to bestow on him in marriage Abishag: who had indeed slept by his father, but because his father was too old he did not lie with her, and she was still a virgin.” So Bathsheba promised him to afford him her assistance very earnestly; and to bring this marriage about; because the King would be willing to gratify him in such a thing; and because she would press it to him very earnestly. Accordingly he went away in hopes of succeeding in this match. So Solomon’s mother went presently to her son, to speak to him about what she had promised, upon Adonijah’s supplication to her. And when her son came forward to meet her, and embraced her; and when he had brought her into the house where his royal throne was set, he sat thereon; and bid them set another throne on the right hand for his mother. When Bathsheba was set down, she said, “O son, grant me one request that I desire of thee, and do not any thing to me that is disagreeable or ungrateful: which thou wilt do if thou deniest me.” And when Solomon bid her to lay her commands upon him, because it was agreeable to his duty to grant her every thing she should ask; and complained that she did not at first begin her discourse with a firm expectation of obtaining what she desired; but had some suspicion of a denial: she intreated him to grant, that his brother Adonijah might marry Abishag.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.3">3.</a> But the King was greatly offended at these words; and sent away his mother, and said, that “Adonijah aimed at great things; and that he wondered that she did not desire him to yield up the Kingdom to him, as to his elder brother: since she desired that he might marry Abishag: and that he had potent friends, Joab the captain of the host, and Abiathar the Priest.” So he called for Benaiah, the Captain of the guards, and ordered him to slay his brother Adonijah. He also called for Abiathar the Priest, and said to him, “I will not put thee to death, because of those other hardships which thou hast endured with my father; and because of the ark which thou hast born along with him: but I inflict this following punishment upon thee, because thou wast among Adonijah’s followers, and wast of his party. Do not thou continue here; nor come any more into my sight: but go to thine own town, and live on thy own fields, and there abide all thy life: for thou hast offended so greatly, that it is not just that thou shouldest retain thy dignity any longer.” For the fore­mentioned cause therefore it was, that the house of Ithamar was deprived of the sacerdotal dignity, as God had foretold to Eli, the grandfather of Abiathar.<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#margin_note_2" id="b2"><sup>2</sup></a> So it was transferred to the family of Phineas, to Zadok. Now those that were of the family of Phineas, but lived privately during the time that the High Priesthood was transferred to the house of Ithamar, (of which family Eli was the first that received it) were these that follow: Bukki, the son of Abishua, the High Priest: his son was Joatham:<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#margin_note_3" id="b3"><sup>3</sup></a> Joatham’s son was Meraioth: Meraioth’s son was Arophæus:<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#margin_note_4" id="b4"><sup>4</sup></a> Arophæus’s son was Ahitub: and Ahitub’s son was Zadok; who was first made High Priest in the reign of David.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.4">4.</a> Now when Joab, the Captain of the host, heard of the slaughter of Adonijah, he was greatly afraid: for he was a greater friend to him, than to Solomon: and suspecting, not without reason, that he was in danger on account of his favour to Adonijah, he fled to the altar; and supposed he might procure safety thereby to himself; because of the King’s piety towards God. But when some told the King what Joab’s supposal was, he sent Benaiah, and commanded him to raise him up from the altar, and bring him to the judgment seat, in order to make his defence. However Joab said, he would not leave the altar, but would die there, rather than in another place. And when Benaiah had reported his answer to the King, Solomon commanded him to cut off his head there;&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.1a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.1b">(1)</a> and let him take that as a punishment for those two <a id="page232">Captains</a> of the host whom he had wickedly slain, and to bury his body: that his sins might never leave his family; but that himself and his father, by Joab’s death, might be guiltless. And when Benaiah had done what he was commanded to do, he was himself appointed to be Captain of the whole army. The King also made Zadok to be alone the High Priest, in the room of Abiathar: whom he had removed.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S1.5">5.</a> But as to Shimei, Solomon commanded that he should build him an house, and stay at Jerusalem, and attend upon him; and should not have authority to go over the brook Cedron; and that if he disobeyed that command, death should be his punishment. He also threatened him so terribly, that he compelled him to take an oath that he would obey. Accordingly Shimei said, that “He had reason to thank Solomon for giving him such an injunction,” and added an oath that he would do as he bid him: and leaving his own countrey, he made his abode in Jerusalem. But three years afterwards, when he heard that two of his servants were run away from him, and were in Gath, he went for his servants in haste; and when he was come back with them, the King perceived it, and was much displeased that he had contemned his commands, and, what was more, had no regard to the oaths he had sworn to God. So he called him, and said to him, “Didst not thou swear never to leave me, nor to go out of this city to another? thou shalt not therefore escape punishment for thy perjury: but I will punish thee, thou wicked wretch, both for this crime, and for those wherewith thou didst abuse my father when he was in his flight: that thou mayst know that wicked men gain nothing at last; although they be not punished immediately upon their unjust practices: but that in all the time wherein they think themselves secure, because they have yet suffered nothing, their punishment increases, and is heavier upon them; and that to a greater degree than if they had been punished immediately upon the commission of their crimes.” So Benaiah, on the King’s command, slew Shimei.</p>
<p class="chapter" id="chap2">
Chapter 2.</p>
<p class="contents">
Concerning the wife of <i>Solomon</i>; concerning his wisdom, and riches; and concerning what he obtained of <i>Hiram</i> for the building of the temple.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.1">1.</a> [About An. 1053.] <span class="smallcaps">Solomon</span> having already settled himself firmly in his Kingdom, and having brought his enemies to punishment, he married the daughter of Pharaoh, King of Egypt: and built the walls of Jerusalem much larger and stronger than those that had been before:&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.2a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.2b">(2)</a> and thenceforward he managed publick affairs very peaceably. Nor was his youth any hindrance in the exercise of justice, or in the observation of the laws, or in the remembrance of what charges his father had given him at his death: but he discharged every duty with great accuracy that might have been expected from such as are aged, and of the greatest prudence: he now resolved to go to Hebron,&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.3a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.3b">(3)</a> and sacrifice to God upon the brazen altar that was built by Moses. Accordingly he offered there burnt-offerings, in number a thousand. And when he had done this, he thought he had payed great honour to God. For as he was asleep that very night, God appeared to him, and commanded him to ask of him some gifts which he was ready to give him, as a reward for his piety. So Solomon asked of God what was most excellent, and of the greatest worth in it self; what God would bestow with the greatest joy; and what it was most profitable for man to receive. For he did not desire to have bestowed upon him either gold, or silver, or any other riches; as a man and a youth might naturally have done: for these are the things that generally are esteemed by most men, as alone of the greatest worth, and the best gifts of God/ But, said he, “Give me, O Lord, a sound mind, and a good <a id="page233">understanding;</a> whereby I may speak and judge the people according to truth and righteousness.” With these petitions God was well pleased; and promised to give him all those things that he had not mentioned in his option, riches, glory, victory over his enemies; and, in the first place, understanding and wisdom: and this in such a degree, as no other mortal man, neither Kings nor ordinary persons ever had. He also promised to preserve the Kingdom to his posterity for a very long time: if he continued righteous, and obedient to him, and imitated his father in those things wherein he excelled. When Solomon heard this from God, he presently leaped out of his bed; and when he had worshipped him, he returned to Jerusalem; and after he had offered great sacrifices before the tabernacle, he feasted all his own family.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.2">2.</a> [About An. 1052.] In these days an hard cause came before him in judgment, which it was very difficult to find any end of. And I think it necessary to explain the fact, about which the contest was; that such as light upon my writings may know what a difficult cause Solomon was to determine; and those that are concerned in such matters may take this sagacity of the King’s for a pattern, that they may the more easily give sentence about such questions. There were two women, who were harlots in the course of their lives, that came to him: of whom she that seemed to be injured began to speak first, and said, “O King, I and this other woman dwell together in one room. Now it came to pass that we both bore a son at the same hour of the same day; and on the third day this woman overlaid her son, and killed it; and then took my son out of my bosom, and removed him to her self: and as I was asleep she laid her dead son in my arms. Now when, in the morning, I was desirous to give the breast to the child, I did not find my own; but saw this woman’s dead child lying by me: for I considered it exactly, and found it so to be. Hence it was that I demanded my son: and when I could not obtain him, I have recourse, my Lord, to thy assistance. For since we were alone, and there was no body there that could convict her, or affright her, she cares for nothing: but perseveres in the stout denial of the fact.” When this woman had told this her story, the King asked the other woman, what she had to say in contradiction to that story? But when she denied that she had done what was charged upon her; and said that it was her child that was living, and that it was her antagonists child that was dead: and when no one could devise what judgment could be given, and the whole court were blind in their understanding, and could not tell how to find out this riddle; the King alone invented the following way how to discover it. He bad them bring in both the dead and the living child; and sent one of his guards, and commanded him to fetch a sword, and draw it, and to cut both the children into two pieces: that each of the women might have half the living and half the dead child. Hereupon all the people privately laughed at the King, as no more than a youth. But in the mean time she that was the real mother of the living child cryed out, that he should not do so; but deliver that child to the other woman as her own: for she would be satisfied with the life of the child, and with the sight of it, although it were esteemed the other’s child. But the other woman was ready to see the child divided; and was desirous moreover that the first woman should be tormented. When the King understood that both their words proceeded from the truth of their passions, he adjudged the child to her that cried out to save it; for that she was the real mother of it: and he condemned the other as a wicked woman, who had not only killed her own child, but was endeavouring to see her friend’s child destroyed also. Now the multitude looked on this determination as a great sign and demonstration of the King’s sagacity and wisdom: and after that day attended to him as to one that had a divine mind.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.3">3.</a> Now the captains of his armies, and officers appointed over the whole countrey were these.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.4a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.4b">(4)</a> Over the lot of Ephraim was Ures; over the toparchy of Bethlehem was Dioclerus. Abinadab, who married Solomon’s daughter, had the region of Dora, and the sea coast under him. The great plain was under Benaiah, the son of Achilus. He also governed all the countrey as far as Jordan. Gabarius ruled over Gilead, and Gaulanitis; and had under him the sixty great and fenced cities [of Og.] Achinadab managed the affairs of all Galilee, as far as Sidon; and had himself also married a <a id="page234">daughter</a> of Solomon, whose name was <i>Basima</i>. Banacates had the sea coast about Arce: as had Shaphat, mount Tabor, and Carmel, and [the lower] Galilee, as far as the river Jordan: one man was appointed over all this countrey. Shimei was intrusted with the lot of Benjamin; and Gabares had the country beyond Jordan. Over whom there was again one governor appointed. Now the people of the Hebrews, and particularly the tribe of Judah, received a wonderful increase, when they betook themselves to husbandry, and the cultivation of their grounds. For as they enjoyed peace, and were not distracted with wars, and troubles; and having besides an unbounded fruition of the most desirable liberty, every one was busy in augmenting the product of their own lands; and making them worth more than they had formerly been.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.4">4.</a> The King had also other rulers, who were over the land of Syria, and of the Philistines, which reached from the river Euphrates to Egypt: and these collected his tributes of the nations. Now these contributed to the King’s table, and to his supper every day&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.5a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.5b">(5)</a> thirty cori of fine flour, and sixty of meal: as also ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures; and an hundred fat lambs: all these were besides what were taken by hunting, harts, and buffaloes, and birds, and fishes, which were brought to the King by foreigners day by day. Solomon had also so great a number of chariots: that the stalls of his horses for those chariots were forty thousand:<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#margin_note_5" id="b5"><sup>5</sup></a> and besides these he had twelve thousand horsemen: the one half of which waited upon the King in Jerusalem, and the rest were dispersed abroad, and dwelt in the royal villages: But the same officer who provided for the King his expences, supplied also the fodder for the horses, and still carried it to the place where the King abode at that time.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.5">5.</a> Now the sagacity and wisdom which God had bestowed on Solomon was so great, that he exceeded the ancients: insomuch that he was no way inferior to the Egyptians, who are said to have been beyond all men in understanding: nay indeed it is evident that their sagacity was very much inferior to that of the King’s. He also excelled and distinguished himself in wisdom above those who were most eminent among the Hebrews at that time for shrewdness. Those I mean were Ethan, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. He also composed Books of Odes, and Songs, a thousand and five. Of Parables and Similitudes three thousand. For he spake a parable upon every sort of tree, from the hyssop to the cedar: and in like manner also about beasts, about all sorts of living creatures, whether upon the earth, or in the seas, or in the air. For he was not unacquainted with any of their natures; nor omitted enquiries about them; but described them all like a philosopher; and demonstrated his exquisite knowledge of their several properties. God also enabled him to learn that skill which expels demons:&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.6a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.6b">(6)</a> which is a science useful, and sanative to men. He composed such incantations also by which distempers are alleviated. And he left behind him the manner of using exorcisms; by which they drive away demons; so that they never return: and this method of cure is of great force unto this day. For I have seen a certain man of my own countrey, whose name was <i>Eleazar</i>, releasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of Vespasian, and his sons, and his Captains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers: the manner of the <a id="page235">cure</a> was this: he put a ring that had a root of one of those sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniack: after which he drew out the demon through his nostrils: and when the man fell down immediately, he abjured him to return into him no more: making still mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he composed. And when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the spectators that he had such a power, he set a little way off a cup or bason full of water, and commanded the demon, as he went out of the man, to overturn it; and thereby to let the spectators know that he had left the man. And when this was done, the skill and wisdom of Solomon was shewed very manifestly. For which reason it is, that all men may know the vastness of Solomon’s abilities, and how he was beloved of God, and that the extraordinary virtues of every kind with which this King was endowed, may not be unknown to any people under the sun; for this reason, I say, it is, that we have proceeded to speak so largely of these matters.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.6">6.</a> Moreover Hiram, King of Tyre, when he had heard that Solomon succeeded to his father’s Kingdom, was very glad of it: for he was a friend of David’s. So he sent ambassadors to him, and saluted him, and congratulated him on the present happy state of his affairs. Upon which Solomon sent him an epistle, the contents of which here follow.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.7a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.7b">(7)</a></p>
<p class="center">
<span class="smallcaps">Solomon</span> <i>to King</i> <span class="smallcaps">Hiram</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
Know thou that my father would have built a temple to God; but was hindred by wars, and continual expeditions: for he did not leave off to overthrow his enemies, till he made them all subject to tribute. But I give thanks to God for the peace I at present enjoy: and on that account I am at leisure, and design to build an house to God. For God foretold to my father that such an houose should he built by me. Wherefore I desire thee to send some of thy subjects with mine, to mount Lebanon, to cut down timber: for the Sidonians are more skilful than our people in cutting of wood. As for wages to the hewers of wood, I will pay whatsoever price thou shalt determine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.7">7.</a> When Hiram had read this epistle, he was pleased with it; and wrote back this answer to Solomon.</p>
<p class="center">
<i>King</i> <span class="smallcaps">Hiram</span> <i>to King</i> Solomon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
It is fit to bless God, that he hath committed thy father’s government to thee; who art a wise man, and endowed with all virtues. As for my self, I rejoice at the condition thou art in: and will be subservient to thee in all that thou sendest to me about. For when by my subjects I have cut down many and large trees of cedar, and cypress wood, I will send them to sea; and will order my subjects to make flotes of them, and to sail to what place soever of thy countrey thou shalt desire, and leave them there. After which thy subjects may carry them to Jerusalem. But do thou take care to procure us corn for this timber; which we stand in need of, because we inhabit in an island.&nbsp;<a id="EndNote_Ant_8.8a" href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.8b">(8)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.8">8.</a> <a id="page236">The</a> copies of these epistles remain at this day, and are preserved not only in our books, but among the Tyrians also: insomuch that if any one would know the certainty about them, he may desire of the keepers of the publick records of Tyre to shew him them, and he will find what is there set down to agree with what we have said. I have said so much out of a desire that my readers may know, that we speak nothing but the truth; and do not compose an history out of some plausible relations, which deceive men and please them at the same time; nor attempt to avoid examination; nor desire men to believe us immediately. Nor are we at liberty to depart from speaking truth, which is the proper commendation of an historian, and yet be blameless. But we insist upon no admission of what we say, unless we be able to manifest its truth by demonstration, and the strongest vouchers.</p>
<p class="indent">
<a id="S2.9">9.</a> Now King Solomon, as soon as this epistle of the King of Tyre was brought him, commended the readiness and good will he declared therein: and repayed him in what he desired, and sent him yearly twenty thousand cori of wheat: and as many baths of oil. Now the bath is able to contain seventy two sextaries. He also sent him the same measure of wine. So the friendship between Hiram and Solomon hereby increased more and more: and they swore to continue it for ever. And the King appointed a tribute to be laid on all the people, of thirty thousand labourers; whose work he rendred easy to them by prudently dividing it among them. For he made ten thousand cut timber in mount Lebanon, for one month: and then to come home, and rest two months; until the time when the other twenty thousand had finished their task at the appointed time. And so afterward it came to pass, that the first ten thousand returned to their work every fourth month. And it was Adoram who was over this tribute. There were also of the strangers who were left by David, who were to carry the stones, and other materials, seventy thousand: and of those that cut the stones, eighty thousand. Of these three thousand and three hundred were rulers over the rest. He also enjoined them to cut out large stones for the foundations of the temple, and that they should fit them and unite them together in the mountain, and so bring them to the city. This was done not only by our own countrey workmen, but by those workmen whom Hiram sent also.</p>

They must rather have belonged to such profane but <i>curious arts</i> as we find mentioned Act.&nbsp;19:13-20. and had been derived from the idolatry and superstition of his Heathen wives and concubines in his old age; when he had forsaken God, and God had forsaken him, and given him up to demoniacal delusions.

Nor is it any other, I suppose, than his own conjectural paraphrase. For when I many years ago enquired into this matter, I found the state of this famous city, and of the island whereupon it stood, to have been very different at different times: insomuch that the accurate Mr. Reland, who much laboured at it, was not able to clear the difficulties thereto relating. See his <i>Palæstina</i> Tom. II. pag. 1046–1056. The result of my enquiries into this matter is in my <i>Essay on the Old Tes. Append.</i> pag. 226, 227. and, with the addition of some later improvements, stands thus; that the best testimonies hereto relating imply, that <i>Palætyrus</i>, or oldest Tyre was no other than that most ancient smaller fort or city Tyre, situated on the continent, and mentioned Josh.&nbsp;19:29. Out of which the Canaanite or Phœnician inhabitants were driven into a large island, that lay not far off in the sea, by Joshua: that this island was then joined to the continent at the present remains of Palætyrus, by a neck of land, over against Solomon’s Cisterns, still so called; and the city’s fresh water probably was carried along in pipes by that neck of land: and that this island was therefore, in strictness, no other than a peninsula; having <i>villages in its fields</i>, Ezek.&nbsp;26:6. and a <i>wall</i> about it, Amos 1:10. and the city was not of so great reputation as Sidon for some ages: that it was attacked both by sea and land by Salmanassar, as Josephus informs us out of Menander: Antiq. <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-9.html#S14.2">IX.14.2</a>. and afterwards came to be the metropolis of Phœnicia, and was afterwards taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, according to the numerous Scripture prophecies thereto relating; Is.&nbsp;23. Jer.&nbsp;25:22. 27:3. 47:4. Ezek.&nbsp;26, 27, 28. and there were remains of that destruction in Heathen authors also, extant in the days of Josephus, though now lost, <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-10.html#S11.1">X.11.1</a>. that seventy&nbsp;years after that destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, this city was in some measure revived and rebuilt, Is.&nbsp;23:17, 18. but that, as the Prophet Ezekiel had foretold, 26:3, 4, 5, 14. 27:34. the sea arose higher than before, till at last it overflowed, not only the neck of land, but the main island or peninsula it self, and destroyed that old and famous city for ever: that however there still remained an adjoining smaller island, once connected to old Tyre it self by Hiram, <i>Contr. Apion.</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/apion-1.html#S17">I.17</a>. which was afterwards inhabited; to which Alexander the Great, with incredible pains, raised a new bank or causeway; and that it plainly appears from Mr.&nbsp;Maundrell, a most authentick eye witness, that the old large and famous city, on the original large island, is now laid so generally under water, that scarce more than 40&nbsp;acres of it, or rather of that adjoining small island, remain at this day: so that perhaps not above an hundredth part of the first island and city is now above water. See Reland pag. 1049, 102. <i>Marsh. Chron.</i> pag. 539. and <i>Maundrell’s Travels</i>, pag. 50. This was foretold in the same prophecies of Ezekiel: and according to them, as Mr. Maundrell distinctly observes, these poor remains of old Tyre are now <i>become like the top of a rock, a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea</i>. Nor does Ovid pretend that the proper island on which old Tyre stood is now visible. See the note on Strabo I. pag.&nbsp;58/101.</p>

Where the error lies is hard to say. If for χόας, <i>congii</i>, or baths we take homers, which were but a tenth part of the bath: or if, in Josephus, we take their diameters only 1/3 of their height, by reading instead of τοσούτοις, τὸ τρίτον τοσούτων, the measures would pretty well agree. But both these conjectures are uncertain, and unsupported. Perhaps Josephus honestly followed his copies here: though they had been corrupted, and he was not able to restore the true reading. In the mean time the 40 baths are probably the true quantity contained in each laver: since they went upon wheels, and were to be drawn by the Levites about the courts of the Priests, for the washings they were designed for; and had they held much more they would have been too heavy to have been so drawn.

And altho’ neither our present Hebrew copy, nor Josephus directly name that number of years; yet do they both say the building it self did not begin till Solomon’s <i>fourth</i> year: and both speak of the preparation of materials beforehand, 1&nbsp;King. 5:18. <i>Antiq.</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#S5.1">VIII.5.1</a>. There is no reason therefore to alter the Septuagint’s number; but we are to suppose three years to have been the just time of the preparation: as I have done in my computation of the expences in building that temple.

For altho’ it appears to me, that the Grecian and Roman most ancient orders of architecture were taken from Solomon’s temple, as from their original patterns; yet it is not so clear that the last and most ornamental order the Corinthian was so ancient. Altho’ what the same Josephus says, <i>Of the War</i>, <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/war-5.html#S5.3">V.5.3</a>. that one of the gates of Herod’s temple was built according to the rules of this Corinthian order, is no way improbable: that order being, without dispute, much older than the reign of Herod. However, upon some trial, I confess I have not hitherto been able fully to understand the structure of this palace of Solomon’s: either as described in our Bibles, or even with the additional help of this description here by Josephus. So I add no more notes about it. Only the reader may easily observe with me, that the measures of this first building in Josephus, 100 cubits long and 50 cubits broad, are the very same with the area of the court of the tabernacle of Moses; and just half an Egyptian <i>Aroura</i> or Acre.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.25a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.25b">(25)</a> This signification of the name <i>Pharaoh</i> appears to be true. And Mr. Reland himself says, “So it is: <span class="smallcaps">piouro</span>, in the Coptick tongue, is a King: which the Greeks would pronounce Φαραώ.” What Josephus adds presently, that in his copy, No King of Egypt was called Pharaoh after Solomon’s father-in-law, does hardly agree to our copies; which have long afterwards the names of <i>Pharaoh Nechoh</i>, and <i>Pharaoh Hophra</i>, 2&nbsp;Kings 23:29. Jer.&nbsp;44:30. besides the frequent mention of that name <i>Pharaoh</i> in the Prophets. However, Josephus himself in his own speech to the Jews, <i>Of the War</i>, <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/war-5.html#S9.4">V.9.4</a>. speaks of Nechao, <i>who was also called Pharaoh</i>; as the name of that King of Egypt with whom Abraham was concerned; of which name <i>Nechao</i> yet we have elsewhere no mention, till the days of Josiah, but only of Pharaoh. And indeed it must be confess’d that here, and §&nbsp;5. we have more mistakes made by Josephus, and those relating to the Kings of Egypt, and to that Queen of Egypt and Ethiopia, whom he supposes to have come to see Solomon, than almost any where else in all his <i>Antiquities</i>; and which are particularly taken notice of by Bochart in his <i>Phaleg.</i> II.26. of the occasions of which mistakes I can give no account.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.30a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.30b">(30)</a> Some blame Josephus for supposing, that the balsam tree might be first brought out of Arabia, or Egypt, or Ethiopia, into Judea, by this Queen of Sheba, since several have said, that of old no countrey bore this precious balsam but Judea. Yet, as my learned friend Mr. Barker suggested to me from Bochart’s <i>Phaleg</i>, II.26. it is not only false that this balsam was peculiar to Judea: but both Egypt and Arabia, and particularly Sabæa had it: which last was that very countrey whence Josephus, if understood not of Ethiopia but of Arabia, intimates this Queen might bring it first into Judea. This Bochart proves from Agatharchides, Diodorus Siculus, and Artemidorus, in Strabo. Nor are we to suppose, that the Queen of Sabaea could well omit such a present as this balsam tree would be esteemed by Solomon, in case it were then almost peculiar to her own countrey. Nor is the mention of balm or balsam, as carried by merchants, and sent as a present out of Judea by Jacob, to the Governor of Egypt, Gen.&nbsp;37:25. and 43:11. to be alleged to the contrary: since what we there render <i>balm</i>, or <i>balsam</i>, denotes rather that <i>turpentine</i>, which we now call <i>turpentine of Chio</i> or <i>Cyprus</i>, the juice of the turpentine tree, than this precious balm. This last is also the same word that we elsewhere render by the same mistake, <i>balm of Gilead</i>; it should be render’d the <i>turpentine of Gilead</i>, Jer. 8:22.</p>

See my Description of the Temples, chap. 10. And although God gave no direction for the lions that adorned his throne, yet does not Solomon seem therein to have broken any law of Moses. For although the Pharisees, and latter Rabbins, have extended the second commandment, to forbid the very <i>making</i> of any image, though without any intention to have it worshipped; yet do not I suppose that Solomon so understood it; nor that it ought to be so understood. The making any other altar for worship, but that at the tabernacle, was equally forbidden by Moses: <i>Antiq.</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-4.html#S8.5">IV.8.5</a>. yet did not the two tribes and an half offend when they made an altar for a memorial only.

Whether the particular account of the arguments made use of, after all, by the false Prophet, against his own belief, and his own conscience, in order to persuade Jeroboam to persevere in his idolatry and wickedness; and which it seems prevailed with him; than which more plausible could not be invented; was intimated in Josephus’s copy, or in some other ancient book, cannot now be determined: our other copies say not one word of it.</p>

Chap. 104. affirms, that “the Phœnicians and Syrians in Palestine [which last are generally supposed to denote the Jews,] owned their receiving circumcision from the Egyptians.” Whereas ’tis abundantly evident, that the Jews received their circumcision from the Patriarch Abraham, Gen.&nbsp;17:9–14. Joh.&nbsp;7:22, 23. as I conclude the Egyptian Priests themselves did also. It is not therefore very unlikely, that Herodotus, because the Jews had lived long in Egypt, and came out of it circumcised, did thereupon think they had learned that circumcision in Egypt, and had it not before. Manetho, the famous Egyptian Chronologer and Historian, who knew the history of his own countrey much better than Herodotus, complains frequently of his mistakes about their affairs: as does Josephus more than once in this Chapter. Nor indeed does Herodotus seem at all acquainted with the affairs of the Jews. For as he never names them; so little or nothing of what he says about them, their countrey, or maritime cities, two of which he alone mentions, Cadytis and Jenysus, proves true. Nor indeed do there appear to have ever been any such cities on their coast. See <i>Essay on the Old Testament, Appendix</i>, pag. 180.

While otherwise the perpetually idolatrous and rebellious ten tribes would naturally have been too powerful for the two tribes, which were pretty frequently free both from such idolatry and rebellion. Nor is there, by consequence, any reason to doubt of the truth of the prodigious number slain, upon so signal an occasion.</p>

As when Virgil bids the husbandman plough <i>naked</i>, and sow <i>naked</i>. When Josephus says, <i>Antiq.</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-4.html#S3.2">IV.3.2.</a> that God had given the Jews the security of armour, when they were <i>naked</i>: and when he here says, that Ahab fell on the Syrians when they were <i>naked and drunk</i>. When <i>Antiq.</i> <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-11.html#S5.8">XI.5.8.</a> he says, that Nehemiah commanded those Jews that were building the walls of Jerusalem, to take care to have their armour on upon occasion, that the enemy might not fall upon them <i>naked</i>. I may add, that the case seems to be the same in the Scripture, when it says, that Saul lay down <i>naked</i> among the Prophets, 1&nbsp;Sam. 19:24. When it says, that Isaiah walked <i>naked and barefoot</i>, Is.&nbsp;20:2–3. and when it says, that Peter, before he girt his fishers coat to him, was <i>naked</i>, Joh.&nbsp;21:7. Nor were the γυμνῆτες, or <i>naked soldiers</i>, other than those <i>levis armaturæ</i>, who were free from the heavy armour of the rest. And the like may be supposed in several other places. What is said of David also gives light to this; who was reproached by Michal for <i>dancing before the ark, and uncovering himself in the eyes of his handmaids; as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself</i>, 2&nbsp;Sam. 6:14, 20. yet it is there expressly said, ℣&nbsp;14. that <i>David was girded with a linen ephod</i>: i.e. he had laid aside his robes of state, and put on only the sacerdotal, Levitical, or sacred garments, proper for such a solemnity.

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.54a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.54b">(54)</a> Josephus’s number, two myriads and seven thousand, agrees here with that in our other copies, as those that were slain by the falling down of the walls of Aphek. But I suspected at first that this number in Josephus’s present copies could not be his original number, because he calls them ὀλίγοι, <i>a few</i>: which could hardly be said of so many as 27000. and because of the improbability of the fall of a particular wall’s killing so many. Yet when I consider that Josephus’s next words, how the rest which were slain in the battel were 10 <i>other myriads</i>; that 27000 are but a <i>few</i> in comparison of 100,000; and that it was not <i>a wall</i>, as in our English version, but <i>the wall</i>, or <i>the intire walls</i> of the city that fell down, as in all the originals, I lay aside that suspicion, and firmly believe that Josephus himself hath, with the rest, given us the just number 27000. This Aphek is by Josephus justly called <i>the Syrian city</i>: as probably one of them which our Bible, and Josephus speak of presently; and which this Benhadad’s predecessors had taken from the Israelites, and were now to be restored to the Israelites; as Reland observes.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.56a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.56b">(56)</a> It is here remarkable, that in Josephus’s copy this Prophet, whose severe denunciation of a disobedient person’s slaughter by a lyon had lately come to pass, was no other than Micaiah, the son of Imlah: who, as he now denounced God’s judgment on disobedient Ahab, seems directly to have been that very Prophet, whom the same Ahab in 1&nbsp;King. 22:8, 18. complains of, as <i>one whom he hated; because he did not prophecy good concerning him, but evil</i>: and who, in that chapter, openly repeats his denunciations against him: all which came to pass accordingly. Nor is there any reason to doubt but this and the former were the very same Prophet. The other ancient Jews agreeing herein with Josephus: as Bishop Patrick assures us, on 1&nbsp;Kings 20:28. This is one of those very many instances, in which the excellency of Josephus’s Temple copy, above all our other copies, most evidently appears.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.57a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.57b">(57)</a> What is most remarkable in this history, and in many histories on other occasions in the <i>Old Testament</i>, is this, that, during the Jewish theocracy, God acted intirely as the supreme King of Israel, and the supreme General of their armies, and always expected that the Israelites should be in such absolute subjection to him, their supreme and heavenly king, and General of their armies, as subjects and soldiers are to their earthly Kings and Generals; and that usually without knowing the particular reasons of their injunctions. See Dr. Harris’s Queries 8–22. after his Comment on Is.&nbsp;53. My Commentary on the Book of Job when published, and my <i>Scripture Politicks</i>, pag. 4–7. where he will see, that the particular Jewish Theocracy did not commence till the rest of the idolatrous and wicked world had rejected that general Theocracy, which till then extended over <i>all mankind</i>.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.58a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.58b">(58)</a> These reasonings of Zedekiah, the false Prophet, in order to persuade Ahab not to believe Micaiah the true Prophet, are plausible: but being omitted in our other copies, we cannot now tell whence Josephus had them; whether from his own temple copy; from some other original author; or from certain ancient Notes. That some such plausible objection was now raised against Micaiah, is very likely: otherwise Jehoshaphat, who used to disbelieve all such false Prophets, could never have been induced to accompany Ahab in these desperate circumstances.</p>
<p class="note">
<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.59a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.59b">(59)</a> This reading of Josephus’s, and of the LXXII, that Jehoshaphat put on, not his own, but Ahab’s robes, in order to appear to be Ahab; while Ahab was without any robes at all, and hoped thereby to escape his own evil fate, and disprove Micaiah’s prophecy against him, is exceeding probable. It gives great light also to this whole History; and shews, that although Ahab hoped Jehoshaphat would he mistaken for him, and run the only risque of being slain in the battel: yet he was intirely disappointed: while still the escape of the good man, Jehoshaphat; and the slaughter of the bad man Ahab, demonstrated the great distinction that Divine Providence made betwixt them.</p>

<a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-8.html#EndNote_Ant_8.60a" id="EndNote_Ant_8.60b">(60)</a>We have here a very wise reflexion of Josephus’s about Divine Providence; and what is derived from it, Prophecy; and the inevitable certainty of its accomplishment: and that when wicked men think they take proper methods to elude what is denounced against them, and to escape the divine judgments thereby threatened them, without repentance, they are ever, by providence, infatuated to bring about their own destruction. And thereby withal to demonstrate the perfect veracity of that God, whose predictions they in vain endeavoured to elude.</p>
