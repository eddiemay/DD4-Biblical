     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">1</FONT> There was a wise man, a great artificer, and the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A> conceived love for him and received him, that he should behold the uppermost dwellings and be an eye-witness of the wise and great and inconceivable and immutable realm of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdg/god">God</A> Almighty, of the very wonderful and glorious and bright and many-eyed station of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>’s servants, and of the inaccessible throne of the <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdl/lord">Lord</A>, and of the degrees and manifestations of the incorporeal hosts, and of the ineffable ministration of the multitude of the elements, and of the various apparition and inexpressible singing of the host of <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdc/cherubim">Cherubim</A>, and of the boundless light.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">2</FONT> At that time, he said, when my one hundred and sixty-fifth year was completed, I begat my son Mathusal <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(Methuselah)</FONT>.  
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">3</FONT> After this too I lived two hundred years and completed of all the years of my life three hundred and sixty-five years.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">4</FONT> On the first day of the month I was in my house alone and was resting on my bed and slept.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">5</FONT> And when I was asleep, great distress came up into my heart, and I was weeping with my eyes in sleep, and I could not understand what this distress was, or what would happen to me.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">6</FONT> And there appeared to me two men, exceeding big, so that I never saw such on earth; their faces were shining like the sun, their eyes too <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(were)</FONT> like a burning light, and from their lips was fire coming forth with clothing and singing of various kinds in appearance purple, their wings <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(were )</FONT>brighter than gold, their hands whiter than snow.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">7</FONT> They were standing at the head of my bed and began to <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/js_h/1/17#17">call me by my name</A>.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">8</FONT> And I arose from my sleep and saw clearly those two men standing in front of me.
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">9</FONT> And I saluted them and was seized with fear and the appearance of my face was changed from terror, and those men said to me:
     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">10</FONT> Have courage, <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bde/enoch">Enoch</A>, do not fear; the eternal <A Href="http://scriptures.lds.org/bdg/god">God</A> sent us to you, and lo!

     <P><FONT Color="#0000FF" Size="-2">11</FONT> And I made haste to obey them and went out from my house, and made to the doors, as it was ordered me, and summoned my sons Mathusal <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(Methuselah)</FONT> and Regim and Gaidad and made known to them all the marvels those <FONT Color="#228822" Size="-1">(men)</FONT> had told me.
