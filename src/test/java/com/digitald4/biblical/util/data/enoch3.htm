<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(1) When I ascended on high to behold the vision
of the <i>Merkaba </i> </span><font size="4">(<i>chariot</i>)</font><span style="font-size:18.0pt"><i> </i>and had entered the six Halls, one within the other: (2)
as soon as I reached the door of the seventh Hall I stood still in prayer before
the Holy One, blessed be lie, and, lifting up my eyes on high (i.e. towards the
Divine Majesty), I said: (3) “Lord of the Universe, I pray thee, that the merit of Aaron, the son of Amram,
the lover of peace and pursuer of peace, who received the crown of priesthood
from Thy Glory on the mount of Sinai, be valid for me in this hour, so that <i>
Qafsiel, </i>the prince, and the angels with him may not get power over me nor
throw me down from the heavens . </span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(4) Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, sent
to me Metatron, his Servant <i>(‘Ebed) </i>the angel, the Prince of the
Presence, and be, spreading his wings, with great joy came to meet me so as to
save me from their hand. </span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(5) And he took me by his band in their sight,

<span style="font-size:18.0pt">“Enter in peace before the high and exalted King

<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(6) Then I entered the seventh Hall, and he led
me to the camp(s) of <i>Shekina </i>and placed me before the Holy One, blessed
be He, to behold the <i>Merkaba.</i> </span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(7) As soon as the princes of the <i>Merkaba </i>
and the flaming <i>Seraphim </i>perceived me, they fixed their eyes upon me.
Instantly trembling and shuddering seized me and I fell down and was benumbed by
the radiant image of their eyes and the splendid appearance of their faces;
until the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them, saying: </span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(8) “My servants, my <i>Seraphim, </i>my <i>
Cherubim </i>and my <i>‘Ophannim! </i>Cover ye your eyes before Ishmael, my son,
my friend, my beloved one and my glory, that he tremble not nor shudder!” (9)
Forthwith Metatron the Prince of the Presence, came and restored my spirit and put me upon my feet. (10) After that (moment)
there was not in me strength enough to say a song before the Throne of Glory of
the glorious King, the mightiest of all kings, the most excellent of all
princes, until after the hour had passed.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.0pt;margin-left:0in">
<span style="font-size:18.0pt">(11) After one hour (had passed) the Holy One,
blessed be He, opened to me the gates of <i>Shekina, </i>the gates of Peace, the
gates of Wisdom, the gates of Strength, the gates of Power, the gates of Speech
<i>(Dibbur), </i>the gates of Song, the gates of <i>Qedushsha, </i>the gates of
Chant. (12) And he enlightened my eyes and my heart by words of psalm, song,
praise, exaltation, thanksgiving, extolment, glorification, hymn and eulogy. And
as I opened my mouth, uttering a song before the Holy One, blessed be He, the
Holy <i>Chayyoth </i>beneath and above the Throne of Glory answered and said:
“HOLY” and “BLESSED BE THE GLORY OF YHVH FROM HIS PLACE !”(i.e. chanted the <i>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">
(2) He answered and said to me: “Because I am Enoch, the son of Jared. (3) For
when the generation of the flood sinned and were confounded in their deeds
saying unto God : ‘ Depart from us, for We desire not the knowledge of thy ways
(Job xxi. 14)’, then the Holy One, blessed he He removed me from their midst to
be a witness against them in the high heavens to all the inhabitants of the
world , that they may not say: ‘ The Merciful One is cruel’. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">
What sinned all those multitudes , their wives, their sons and their daughters,
their horses, their mules and their r cattle and their r property , and all the
birds of the world, all of which the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed from
their world together with them in the waters of the flood ? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">
Nor may say: What though the generation of the flood did sin; the beasts and the
birds, what had they sinned, that they should perish with them?’ </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">
(5) Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, lifted me up in their lifetime before
their eyes to be a witness against them to the future world. And the Holy One,
blessed be He, assigned me for a prince and a ruler among the ministering
angels. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">
(6) In that hour three of the ministering angels, <i>‘UZZA, ‘AZZA </i>and
‘AZZAEL came forth and brought charges against me in the high heavens, saying
before the Holy One, blessed be He ‘‘ Said not the Ancient Ones (First Ones)
rightly before Thee: ‘Do not create man! ‘“ The Holy One, blessed be He,
answered and said unto them: “I have made and I will bear, yea, I will carry and
will deliver”. (Is. xlvi. 4.) </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:4.0pt"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">

“What doeth he in the Raqia’? “ </span></p>

of you, and hence he shall be a
prince and a ruler over you in the high heavens.” (9) Forthwith all stood up and
went out to meet me, prostrated themselves before me and said: “Happy art thou

of the world to the other, and each one brought silver, gold, precious stones
and pearls in heaps like unto mountains and hills making idols out of them
throughout all the world. And they erected the idols in every quarter of the
world: the size of each idol was 1000 parasangs. (8) And they brought down the
sun, the moon, planets and constellations, and placed them before the idols on
their right hand and on their left, to attend them even as they attend the Holy

of a white drop (is this) that ascends on high, and (lo, he is merely) a gnat

children of men have denied me and my great Kingdom and are gone worshipping
idols, I have removed my <i>Shekina </i>from among them and have lifted it up on
high. But this one whom I have taken from among them is an ELECT ONE among (the
inhabitants of) the world and he is equal to all of them in faith, righteousness
and perfection of deed and I have taken him for (as) a tribute from my world
under all the heavens”. </span></p>
