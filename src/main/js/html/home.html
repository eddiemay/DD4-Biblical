        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Dabar דבר is the word for "word", "speak" or "spoke" in Hebrew. It is what is spoken to humble
          servants of יהוה (<scripture ref="Gen 15:1,35:14-15, Exo 4:30,9:21,16:23"/>). We are
          commanded to live by the spoken word of יהוה (<scripture ref="Exo 19:8, Matt 4:4, Luke 4:4"/>).
          Here at dabar.cloud we present the word of יהוה alone with tools to help better understand
          the word so that we can guard the words of the Torah and His Commandments which is the whole
          duty of man (<scripture ref="Deut 17:19, Ecclesiastes 12:13, "/>)
