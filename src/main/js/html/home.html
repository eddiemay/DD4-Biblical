        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>
          The Mackabees Ministry was created out of love for the Most High Yahuwah to teach people about Him, His Son
          Yahushi and His Commandments that are found in his Law which is called the Torah. We believe that keeping His
          Commandments is how you show love for Him (<scripture ref="1 John 5:3"/>), We are not to even think the
          Messiah came to do away with His Commandments (<scripture ref="Matt 5:17"/>) and keeping them is a requirement
          for everlasting life (<scripture ref="Matt 19:16-19"/>). This website is a resource to be used for those that
          are waking up to who they are to learn how to get inline with our Abba in order inherit the Kingdom.
