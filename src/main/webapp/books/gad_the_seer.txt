1. The First Vision

1 In the thirty-first year of King David’s reign in Jerusalem, which is the thirty-eighth year of David’s reign, the Word of the LORD came to Gad the Seer in the month of Iyar, near the stream of the Kidron Valley, saying:

2 “Thus says the LORD: ‘Go, be courageous, and stand in the midst of the stream, and cry in a great voice: “Tarry and hasten, tarry and hasten, tarry and hasten, for there is still a vision for the son of Jesse.” 3 And during the cry face the Eastern Gate, on the east side of the city, and stretch forth your hands toward heaven.’” 4 And I did exactly what I had been commanded to do.

5 And it came to pass when I finished crying out, I opened my eyes and saw a yoke of oxen, led by a donkey and a camel, coming up from the Kidron stream, the donkey on the right side of the yoke and the camel on the left.

6 And a great voice like the roll of thunder was following them, crying with a bitter voice:

7 “Seer, seer, seer, these are four mixtures that confuse the people of the LORD. 8 For the impure and the pure have been mixed, and then impurity took control over purity; a mixture from Seir [Edom] to rule over them, 9 to increase power over, and betray, a righteous doer, 10 to destroy holiness, to crown wickedness, to set up impure matters in the guise of purity.”

11 And after the voice, a great quake occurred that shook over the impurity and blew the donkey and the camel into the moon with a stormy wind. 12 And the moon was opened and looked like a bow, a semi-circle, and both her points reached toward the ground.

13 And lo, the sun came out of heaven in the shape of a man, with a crown on his head, carrying over his right shoulder a lamb, despised and rejected. 14 And on the crown on his head three shepherds are seen, shackled with twelve shackles 15 and these shackles were of gold, plated with silver.

And the voice of the Lamb was heard, great and dreadful like the voice of a lion roaring over his prey:

“Woe unto me! Woe unto me! Woe unto me! My image [Messiah] has been diminished, My refuge has been lost, My lot and destiny has turned Me

over to My spoilers, and I was defiled until evening by the touch of impurity.”

16 And it came to pass when the voice of the Lamb ceased speaking, lo, a man dressed in linen came with three vinebranches and twelve palms in his hand. 17 And he took the Lamb from the hand of the sun and put the crown on His head, and the vine-branches and palms on His heart. 18 And the man, dressed in linen, cried like a ram’s horn, saying:

“What are you doing here, impurity, and how did you get here, impurity, 19 that you have carved yourself a place to combine impurity with My covenant that I have set with the vine-branches and palms?”

20 And I heard the Lamb’s shepherd saying:

“There is a place with Me for the pure, but not for the impure, for I am a holy God, and I do not want the impure, I only want the pure; 21 even though I created them both, and My eyes are equally on them both. 22 But there is an advantage to the abundance of purity over the abundance of impurity, just like there is an advantage of a man over a shadow. 23 For the shadow does not exist without man, and only by the man’s existence is the shadow given to the tired and exhausted; this

applies in the same way to the pure and impure. 24 For all gates of intelligence are turned around since the death of the eight branches of the vine. 25 As is found in words of righteousness in the true book, but because of the wanderings of the sheep, their rest, and divisions, 26 intelligence is stopped up until I do greatly in keeping grace.”

27 I saw that impurity was driven from the moon and was given over to a consuming wrath, ground into fine dust, and blown away by the daily wind. 28 And the day burns as a furnace to remove impurity and to erase the transgressions. 29 And the Lamb was put on the moon forever and ever. 30 And the Lamb took from the pure the impurity that had been mixed with them, and brought it as a peace offering sacrifice on the altar before El Shaddai, jealous LORD of Hosts.

31 And I heard those singing the song of the Lamb, saying:

32 “I shall give thanks unto You, O LORD, for though You were angry with me, You forgave. 33 For the LORD is my strength and song, and He is become my redeemer. 34 I will sing unto the LORD, for He is highly exalted; He had thrown the horse and his rider into the Sea of Reeds. 35 Arise, intelligence; arise, power; arise, kingship; 36 arise, majesty and glory; arise help of the LORD. 37 For God has saved one who had taken

away and obliterated the impurity from the earth. 38 He fought my fight and brought into the light my righteousness by His help.

39 “My help cometh from the Lord who made heaven and earth.” Psalm 121:2

40 Truly, who is like You, glorious in holiness, but not in impurity? 41 For You are great over all; raised over all, You spoke and acted. 42 For You declared the end from the beginning, and You sealed everything by Your words and turned my heart and convicted me. 43 For Your seal is upon me, my Lord, and these are three vine-branches and twelve palms that are on my heart. 44 You glorified me, You erased the vanity of fearing man, and You gave me a pure heart forever. 45 For that I will praise You at all times, and thank You among the nations, for You have greatly redeemed me for my king and showed favor to the Messiah, David’s seed, forever and ever.”

46 And I heard a voice crying from heaven, saying:

47 “You are My Son, You are My firstborn, You are My first-fruits. 48 Haven’t I brought You up from the brook of Egypt wholeheartedly to be My daily delight? 49 But You have put way My gifts and dressed up the impure with the pure, and that is why all these things have happened to You.

50 And who is like unto You among all the creatures on earth? For they lived in Your shadow and by Your wounds they were healed. 51 For that, consider well that which is before You. 52 Because You have fulfilled the words of the shepherd all the days You have been in the sun and You did not leave them; therefore, all this honor shall be Yours.”

53 And I, Gad, son of Ahimelech of the Jabez family, of the tribe of Judah, son of Israel, was amazed by the vision and could not settle my spirit.

54 And the one dressed in linen came down to me and touched me, saying: “Write these words and seal them with the seal of truth, for I AM who I AM is My name, and with My name you shall bless the whole house of Israel, for they are of a true seed. 55 In a little while you shall go, and be quietly gathered to your fathers, but at the end of days you shall see with your own eyes all these things, not as a vision, but in reality. 56 For in those days they shall not be called Jacob, but Israel; for no iniquity will be found in their remnant, for they will belong entirely to the LORD.

57 And these words will restore your life and spirit. And this shall be the sign unto you: when you enter the town, you will find My servant David while he is reading these words from the Book of Covenant:

58

‘And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.’ Leviticus 26:44

59 And you shall tell him about the scene you have just seen; and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.”

60 And it came to pass, when I came to the house of David, the man of God, I found him as the one dressed in linen had said, and I told him of all my visions. 61 Then David spoke the words of this song unto the LORD, saying: “I love You, O LORD, my strength.” 62 And to me he said: “The LORD has blessed you and has not removed His covenant from you, for He is true, and His word is true, and His seal is true.”

2. The Second Vision

1 After these true things, I had a vision from God saying: 2 “Set your face eastward, northward, southward, and westward. 3 And whistle with your mouth as a bird whistles to its young and say: ‘Four corners of the earth, listen to the Word of the LORD. 4 Thus saith the LORD, who sits and dwells over the cherubim: ‘Give, give, give, take out, take out, take out My seed that I have sown in you, for the time for the seed has come. 5 For yet a little while I shall collect My seed on My threshing floor. 6 And the threshing floor will be holy; an impure seed will not be found there. 7 Prior to those days My seed was mixed with lentils, and barley, and fitches, beans, and gourds.

8 And in the end of days the sower shall be true and the seed shall be true and from the seed all the land will be blessed. 9 Be joyful and glad, remnant of Judah and rejected of Israel, for salvation is with the LORD. 10 As you shall be a curse and blasphemy to all the families of the earth, so shall you be a blessing and grace forever. 11 At that time no cursed or unholy people will be found among you, 12 for everyone will join you in the covenant, the Law, testimonies, statutes, and ordinances. 13 And you and they shall have one God, one covenant, one law, one language, for all shall speak in the language of Hebrew, the holy language. 14 Blessed are you, O Israel, who is like

unto you? A people saved by the LORD, for He will go before you to fight your wars with your enemies.

15 Woe to you, O Edom, that sits in the land of Kittim in the north of the sea. 16 For your destroyers will emerge from a terrible nation. They will not even leave you a remnant. 17 For you have said: ‘I sit on high, and only I have a covenant with the God of gods, for the LORD chose me instead of His holy people, for He abhorred them. 18 And His former people, despised and rejected, did not truly know the LORD [the Father] because they did not know His image [the Son]. 19 We are truly wise and intelligent; we know the LORD and His Law, we know His image [the Son] and presence [the Holy Spirit].’ 20 But thus says the LORD: ‘Because you rose up in pride to brag about the God of gods, know that you will perish in your conceitedness. 21 For why would you put confidence in man, whose life is like a vapor, which begins in the morning, and is gone by noon-day, placing him to sit beside God. 22 For it is not you whom I knew formerly, and where is the bill of divorce of My people, that you said would be a prey; show it to Me!

23 Your corpses will fall among My people.’ 24 O jealous Yahweh, come out; come out of your place and smite Edom; consume them. 25 Come to Zerephath, come to Sepharad, come to Ashkenaz, come to Garmania; they shall come and fall in the lowest pit, in destruction, and in

the shadow of death, for your mouth will fail you, and no one will help you.

26 At the end of days Michael the great prince will stand up in war like a whirlwind against Samael the prince of this world to put him under his feet, in the wind of the LORD, and it shall be eaten up; for the LORD has spoken it.

27 At the end of days the robbed will overcome the robber, and the weak, the strong, truly and in righteousness. 28 Your God is your Savior, O Israel; with Him you will be saved, for He is a merciful God. He will not abandon you, 29 for you shall keep on doing all that I commanded you in the Law of Moses My servant.’

3. The Moabite

1 When the feast of Passover came, on the fifteenth of the first month, a Moabite shepherd came to David and talked with him saying: “My lord the king, you have known that I, your servant, have been loyal to Israel from my youth, and now take me away from dwelling among uncircumcised people and circumcise the flesh of my foreskin to take away my reproach, so that I can sit among your people.” 2 And David said: “the LORD does not want your people, and He commanded,

‘An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the LORD forever.’ Deuteronomy 23:3

And we cannot seek your peace nor your prosperity; but how can I help you today?” 3 The servant answered: “Is it not it true that Ruth was of our people, and you are one of her children and descendants, and the LORD has chosen you and your descendants forever?” 4 Then said he: “You have given a convincing argument. Stand here with me to ask from the mouth of my Lord.” 5 And David asked the LORD about the statement of the Moabite servant. 6 And David said: “O LORD, LORD of Hosts, teach me wondrous things out of Your Law so that I may know how to rule for this servant, and what should be done with him.” 7 And the LORD said to Nathan the prophet: “Go to

David My servant, and tell him the message that I tell you.” 8 And Nathan went to David, to his chambers, saying: “This is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘I have heard your prayer, so tell the Moabite: ‘You are a Moabite man, not a Moabite woman, for I never said a ‘Moabite woman’ and ‘Ammonite woman,’ because their women and daughters belong to the LORD; however you are cursed by the LORD, and forbidden to enter the LORD’s assembly.” 9 When the Moabite heard the message of the LORD, he cried out and exclaimed: “I am forbidden from entering the assembly of the LORD.” 10 And the king took him and appointed him a shepherd among David’s shepherds, and he was there until the third year of the reign of King Solomon, then he died. 11 And he had a daughter whose name was Sephirah; she had a beautiful form and was very fair to look upon. King Solomon took her to be his concubine, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the other concubines, and she became the chief of the concubines’ residence. 12 And this became the statute in Israel forever.

4. David, the Wise Judge

1 In those days a man from Bethlehem, the city of David, went to Jerusalem to pay the vow which he had vowed unto the LORD. His name was Zabad the Parhi, and he was of the family of the Perezites. 2 Zabad’s father was very sick, even unto the point of death, so Zabad vowed:

“When the LORD heals my father of his sickness, I will weigh out two talents of silver and give them to the House of the LORD, into the hand of King David.”

3 And it came to pass, when he was at the house of the shepherds along the way, he lost the pouch with the money in it and he was upset. 4 He came to the city of Jerusalem, into the inner city, and he wrote on all the gates these words:

5 “Anyone who finds a lost pouch with two talents of silver and brings it to me I will give him a talent of silver as a reward.”

6 After a while, a man from the tribe of Dan came and had in his hand the pouch with the silver talents that he found along the way and he gave it to the owner of the pouch. 7 And the Danite said to Zabad: “Give me the talent of silver as you promised.” 8 And the Zabad said: “No, there

were actually three talents in my pouch and you have already stolen one talent; I mistakenly wrote down the wrong number.” 9 So both of them came and stood before the king. 10 And the king said to the Zabad: “Swear unto me by the LORD, that you truly had three talents of silver in your pouch.” And Zabad swore to him by the LORD. 11 And the king continued, saying to the Danite: “Swear unto me by the LORD, that you only found two talents of silver the pouch.” And he swore to him by the LORD. 12 And David said to Zabad: “Give the pouch with the talents back to the Danite, because this is his money that the LORD has given to him by chance. 13 Now, go and write on the city gates:

‘Whoever finds the pouch with three talents should bring it to me,’

because this is not your pouch.” 14 And David took the pouch with the talents of silver from the hand of the Zabad and gave it to the Danite. 15 And the Danite bowed his head and prostrated himself to the earth and said: “Long live my lord, King David, forever.” 16 And all Israel heard of this judgment and they marveled over David and were overjoyed; because they saw that he was full of the wisdom of God.

5. The Fire-Angel and the Philistines

1 All the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight against Israel. There were so many multitudes of Philistines that they could not be numbered. 2 And David was greatly distressed because he was afraid of the Philistines. 3 And the LORD said to Gad: “Go and tell David My servant: ‘Do not be worried about these uncircumcised Philistines, because tomorrow I will give them, and those other oppressors with them, into your hand.” 4 And David said to Gad: “I am not worthy of all the mercies that the LORD has shown to me, but blessed be the name of the LORD forever and ever.” 5 That night, a fire-angel came from heaven with his drawn sword in his hand. 6 And he attacked the camp of the uncircumcised. It was such a great slaughter that none of them were left alive. 7 And it came to pass the next morning they came to David saying: “Behold, all the Philistines have been killed by someone who rose up against them; not a single one of them was left alive.” 8 And David raised his voice and said: “Now I know that nothing can hinder the LORD. He can save us from many or few, and His salvation can be in a blink of an eye.” 9 And he said: “Blessed are You, O LORD, who has been taking revenge for us on our enemies.” 10 And he set up a pillar and called it the “Pillar of Revenge” unto this day.

6. David’s Covenant

1 The LORD said to Gad: “Go tell David My servant: 2 ‘Thus says the LORD:

‘Let not the mighty man glory in his might. 3 But let him that glories glory in this, that My help is with him. 4 Then you should go and fear not, for the LORD is with you.’”

5 And Gad came and told David what the LORD had said. 6 And David said to Gad: “I have known the help of the LORD from my youth. 7 For who struck down the lion and the bear? Who destroyed the Philistines? Who destroyed my enemies? Was it not by the help of God?” 8 And when the LORD heard that, He was very pleased with David’s heart. 9 And He said:

“Because David has acknowledged My help instead of his own glory, My help will dwell in the house of David forever.”

10 And Gad told David what the LORD said. 11 And David bowed down before the LORD and said: “Blessed be the LORD for I have found favor in His eyes.”

7. David’s Sin of Counting

1 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel 2 and He moved Satan against David, saying: “Go, number Israel and Judah,” to bring them the evil He spoke through Samuel the seer. 3 And the king said to Joab the captain and to the princes of the people: “Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number the people, and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.” 4 And Joab said unto the king: “May the LORD add unto the people how many so ever they may be, a hundredfold, and may the eyes of the LORD our God watch over them; but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? And why should it be a cause of trespass unto Israel? For the LORD has said: ‘Which cannot be numbered for the multitude.’” 5 Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel. 6 And they passed over the Jordan, and camped in Aroer, south of the town in the middle of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer. 7 And they came to Gilead, and then to the land of the Hittites, to Kadesh, and they came to Dan and Enan, and round about to Zidon. 8 And they came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. And they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. 9 So when they had gone

through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. But Joab did not number Levi and Benjamin, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab. 10 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were eight hundred thousand valiant men and three hundred thousand men that drew a sword, and in Judah there were four hundred and seventy thousand valiant men and thirty thousand men that drew a sword. 11 And the LORD God was displeased with this act of Israel, and He sent Gad the seer to David, saying: 12 “Thus said the LORD: ‘I am the King of Israel, and I am their portion. I am their avenger, I am their fortress and might, and you know that it is not with a sword or a spear that I will save, and not with a man of valiance that draws a sword, for this is the portion of the heathens that stand on their might and many warriors. 13 But you are not like that, for I am a lone warrior and there is no one with Me. Why would you do this evil to number your people? For that I will strike Israel, so that you will know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.” 14 And David’s heart was grieved after that. And David said unto the LORD: “I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now O LORD, I beg You, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” 15 And David rose up in the morning, and the Word of the LORD had already come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer, saying: 16 “Go and say unto David: ‘Thus says the LORD: ‘I offer you three things; choose one of them, that I may do it unto you.” 17 So Gad came to David and told him, and said unto him: “Shall four years of famine come unto the land of Israel and three years in

the land of Judah? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you, while the sword of your enemies overtake you? Or shall there be three days of the sword of the LORD, which is pestilence, in your land, and the angel the LORD destroying throughout all the land of Israel? Now advise yourself, and decide what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.” 18 And David said unto Gad: “I am in a great strait; let me fall, and let us fall now, into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies are great; and let me not fall into the hand of man.” 19 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the morning even to the time appointed; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men. 20 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was destroying it, the LORD beheld, and He repented Him of the evil, and said to the angel that was destroying the people: “It is enough; now stay your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 21 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD standing between the heaven and the earth, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. And David and the elders, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 22 And David said unto God: “Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? Even I it is that have sinned and acted wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? O LORD my God, let Your hand be against me and against my father’s house, but not against Your people, that they should be plagued. Shall not the judge of all the earth do justice?” 23 And the LORD said: “They incited Satan against you to number them, saying thus: ‘We will be like

all the nations,’ but I am a God of justice; may I return their high heart into their own bosoms.

24 For a broken or a contrite heart I shall not despise forever.” Psalm 51:17

25 And the angel of the LORD told Gad to tell David that David should go up and rear an altar unto the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. 26 And David went up according to the words of Gad which he spoke in the name of the LORD. 27 And Ornan was looking and he saw the king and his four sons with him. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 28 And Ornan looked and saw David, and he went out of the threshing floor, and bowed down to David with his face to the ground. 29 Then David said to Ornan: “Sell me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD; you shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stayed from the people.” 30 And Ornan said unto David: “Take it, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes; lo, I give the oxen also for burnt offering, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering; I give it all.” 31 And King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will verily buy it for the full price; for I will not take that which is yours for the LORD, nor offer a burnt offering without paying for it.” 32 So David gave Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold, and for the cattle fifty shekels of silver, by weight. 33 And David built there an altar unto The LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar

of burnt offering. 34 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put his sword back into the sheath thereof, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

35 At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, and He did not despise him, then he sacrificed there unto the LORD for the rest of his life. 36 For David would no longer go and sacrifice unto the LORD in the high place at Gibeon, where there was an altar unto the LORD and a tabernacle which Moses made, for he was terrified and weakened because of the sword of the angel of the LORD that he had seen.

8. David’s Sermon

1 The LORD appeared unto David when he was old and said to him:

“Behold, I am with you, and I am your God, and behold, My covenant is with you; do not be afraid, nor discouraged, because your God is your helper.”

2 And David bowed down to the LORD and rejoiced in his heart. 3 And the LORD said: “Speak these words in My name to the people and make sure they understand and obey so that they will live. If they do, I will no longer be angry with them.” 4 And the LORD put His words in his mouth. 5 Then David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem, and he made a pulpit of wood for himself and he stood upon it and addressed all the people. He opened his mouth and said:

David’s teaching 6 “Hear, O Israel, your God and my God is one, the only one, and unique; there is no one like His individuality. He is hidden from everyone; He always has been and always will be [eternal]. He fills His creation, but His creation does not fill Him. He sees everything, but is not seen; He knows the future and reveals it to mankind, for He is the never-ending God, and there is no end to His presence,

power and truth; whole worlds are full of His glory. 7 He gave each person free choice: if one person wants to do good, he will be helped, but if a person wants to do evil, he will find a way. 8 As for us, we will worship our God who is our King, our Lord, and our Savior, with love and awe. For your wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD and if you truly understand Him, you will depart from evil. 9 Remember and obey the Law of Moses, the man of God, so that you will live a blessed life all of your days. 10 Ask your fathers, and they will teach you, ask your elders, and they will instruct you.

11 Do not just listen to the Law, but be strong and valiant to obey all of it. 12 Hearing is like the seed, but a deed shows that the seed has taken root in you. It then becomes a tree of belief which produces the fruit of true righteousness. 13 What becomes of a smelly rotten seed if no root will come out of it? 14 So, hurry. Be quick to hear and act. For if you are a true seed, if you have belief and righteousness, then the LORD will bless you all with peace.

15 Live in peace with each other. Love the deeds, and those created in the image of the LORD like your own selves, 16 because it is a sign that you love the Creator, if you love His creation. 17 You cannot take hold of the one but withdraw your hand from the other. Love the LORD and also man so that it will be well with you all the days of your life.”

18 David raised his voice, and lifted his hands toward heaven, and said: “LORD, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, God, merciful and gracious, guard Israel forever. 19 Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance, and tend to them, and uphold them forever.” 20 And all the people called out: “Amen, amen.” 21 And David sent the people away and they went home peacefully.

9. King Hiram of Tyre

1 Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers unto David saying: 2 “I know that the LORD your God is the one true God, so now deal with me as a true brother and teach me the Law of your God, for I will worship Him all the days of my life.” 3 Then the messengers came to David with an offering in their hands for the LORD and for David. They told him everything that Hiram had said and presented him with the offerings. 4 And David replied to Hiram: 5 “Go and tell my brother, Hiram: ‘This is what David, your brother, says:

‘Reverence the LORD, creator of heaven and fire, the sea and the earth, the wet and the dry, the heat and the cold, the mineral and the vegetation, the living and the speaking, 6 the planets, the Pleiades and Orion, the sun and the moon, the substantial and the spiritual, the wandering stars, the senses, and everything. 7 These were all created without a blemish by El Shaddai whose name is Yahweh. 8 If you do this and observe the commandments that were ordered to the children of Noah [Noahide Laws], your father, then God will bless you all the days of your life. 9 We are both His allies; but we are different from you by the Law of truth, sealed by the seal of Shaddai, called children of the true

God. 10 We must therefore obey the whole Law that HaShem commands of us, saying:

‘And you shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak unto the children of Israel.’ Exodus 19:6

11 But He has not dealt the same way with any other nation as He has with us. He did not choose us for any other reason than the great love that He has for us.”

12 The messengers then returned to Hiram their king and told him everything that King David had told them. 13 And Hiram rejoiced with all his heart and called all his princes and servants and said to them: 14 “Tyrians and Sidonians, listen carefully to what I am about to tell you. 15 Have reverence and respect for El Shaddai, who is the God of Israel. He made everything by speaking and by the breath of His mouth; and who will tell Him what He can do? For He is one. 16 Repeat after me:

‘Blessed is the LORD God of Israel who chooses His people, and blessed is David, His servant, king of His people, and blessed is Israel whom the LORD has chosen to be His inheritance. 17 We would be blessed to simply be the servants of the children of Israel that are called children of the LORD, their God.’”

18 And all his princes and his servants replied: “Amen, may it be so.” 19 And Hiram lifted up his voice and said:

“I have seen, but not now, I have beheld, but not nigh: there shall step forth a sun from David, and a moon shall rise out of the house of Judah, and shall smite all the children of Ham, and break down all the children of Japheth, and he will possess all the kingdoms of the world.”

Variant of Numbers 24:17-18

And who is like the LORD, God above all gods? 20 And who is like Israel a people above the nations? May our end be like theirs.”

21 When the LORD heard what Hiram had said, He was very pleased with him. 22 And the LORD said unto Gad, the seer of David: 23 “Go unto my servant and tell him the message that I gave you.” 24 And Gad, the one in whose hand was the word of the LORD, came to David, and said,

“Thus says the LORD God of Hosts: ‘I have heard what Hiram, king of Tyre, has said and what his princes and servants have said, and I am very pleased. 25 Therefore I will give him and his people a heart of wisdom and understanding to prepare My house where I shall put My name, and that will cause his kingdom to grow, for I have chosen them and will not reject them.’”

26 And David said to Gad: “Now I know that the LORD our God rewards all His creatures and all the works He has created with goodness, because He is a God of mercy, who dwells on high and looks after the lowly, and whoever is banished will not remain an outcast from Him. Blessed be the LORD forever; Amen, and Amen. 27 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him and towards His works. 28 Bless the LORD, all you His works, in all His places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul. Hallelujah.”

10. Psalm 145

1 At that time David wrote this psalm of praise: I will exalt You, my God, O King; and I will bless Your name forever and ever. 2 Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever. 3 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and His greatness is unsearchable. 4 Generation after generation shall praise Your works, and shall declare Your mighty acts. 5 The glorious splendor of Your majesty, and Your wondrous works I will declare. 6 And men shall speak of the might of Your awesome works; and I will declare Your greatness. 7 They shall abundantly express the memory of Your goodness, and they shall sing of Your righteousness. 8 The LORD is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and great in mercy. 9 The LORD is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all His works. 10 All Your works shall thank You, O LORD; and Your saints bless You. 11 They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom, and talk of Your power, 12 to make known to the sons of men His mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of His kingdom. 13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures through all generations. 14 All Your enemies have fallen, O LORD, and all of their might has come to naught. 15 The LORD sustains all those who fall, and raises up all those who are bowed down. 16 The eyes of all wait upon You; and You give them their food in due season. 17 You open Your hands, and satisfy the desire of

every living thing with favor. 18 The LORD is righteous in all His ways, and holy in all His works. 19 The LORD is near to all who call upon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth. 20 He will grant the desire of them that fear Him: and He will also hear their prayer, and save them. 21 The LORD preserves all them that love Him: but all the wicked He will destroy. 22 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD, and let all flesh bless His holy name forever and ever.

11. Psalm 144

1 The Psalm of David praising the LORD on the day when Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, and Jonathan the son of Shimea killed a man of great stature, saying: Blessed be the LORD my rock, who instructs my hands for war, and my fingers for battle.

2 My mercy, and my fortress, my high tower, and my deliverer; my protector and He in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me. 3 LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You make account of him? 4 Man is like unto a breath: his days are as a shadow that passes away. 5 O LORD, bow Your heavens, and come down: touch the mountains so that they smoke. 6 Send lightning, and scatter them: shoot out Your arrows, and destroy them. 7 Send forth Your hand from above; deliver me, and deliver me out of many waters, out of the hand of foreigners; 8 whose mouths speak falsehood, and whose right hand is a right hand of lying.

9 O God, I will sing to You a new song: I will sing praise to You on a psaltery of ten strings, 10 who gives salvation to kings, who rescues Your servant David from an evil sword. 11 Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood; 12 May our children be as plants, grown up in their youth: may our daughters be

cornerstones, hewn like the form of the temple. 13 May our garners be full affording all manner of store; may our sheep increase by thousands and ten thousands in our markets. 14 May our oxen be strong to labor; no breaking in, nor going out, no complaining in our streets. 15 Happy is the people that is in such a case. Happy is the people whose God is the LORD. 16 Happy is he who waits until there will be good to all Israel forever.

12. David’s Death

1 David addressed the LORD and all of Israel shortly before his death. David said:

2 “Our blessed God, who is great, the only one, guileless, just, 3 avenger and benefactor of the miserable, beloved, our Father, El Shaddai. 4 Holy One, have mercy upon the vine, Your good inheritance. 5 Answer us this very day as we call upon You. 6 My Lord, hear my prayer and supplication, for You hear prayers of all people; 7 listen and accept the cry of Your people, 8 for they are Your flock and Your inheritance. 9 Send Your light and truth to help them. 10 Give them one heart to worship You, one shoulder [to serve], as one body, so they will be one in Your hand. 11 And do not lose any of them, for Your name is to be one, as our fathers and mothers are one. 12 For that, hear O Israel, the LORD is our God, the LORD is one. 13 Do not turn unto the idols, for they are false and will completely pass away. 14 Cling only unto your God, for only He can be your avenger and fortress. 15 Only He can defeat your spiritual enemies and physical enemies and put them under your feet; 16 only He can bring you into the New Jerusalem of the future, 17 where you will see Him face to face, and be in the presence

of the living God that is seen face to face. And you are one people; if you grow in belief, you will be filled with gates of intelligence. 18 Blessed is the eye that has seen all these things. 19 But if you grow in unbelief, you will reach gates of impurity. 20 So then cleanse and purify yourself before the LORD, your king, and it will be well with you all the days of your life.”

21 And David died in the afternoon on the Sabbath day, in the fortieth year of his reign over Judah and Israel. 22 He was seventy years old when he died, and he was buried with great honor in the city of David. 23 And the rest of the deeds of King David, during his mighty reign and the events that befell him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the countries, behold, they are written in the Book of Samuel the Seer and in the Book of Nathan the Prophet.

13. Tamar

1 Solomon was able to strengthen his kingdom, because the LORD his God was with him, and greatly magnified him. 2 Later, David’s daughter, Tamar, sister of Absalom, fled to the house of the king of Geshur, and she spent a year and eight months in her mother’s home, which is in the king’s palace. 3 And King Solomon did not know that she left, because she went secretly, and she concealed her going not only from the king, but all the people as well. 4 And King Solomon said: “I shall pay a reward of royal clothes plus fifty shekels of gold to whoever finds Tamar, the sister of my father, and brings her to me.” 5 And the king’s servants searched for her throughout all the land of Israel, but they could not find her. 6 And she was hiding at her mother’s home in Geshur, at her grandfather’s [the king] palace. 7 And there was a friend of the king, whose name was Pirshaz, and he lusted after the young woman very much, for she was very beautiful and fair to look upon.

8 In those days the king of Geshur went to see King Solomon, as all the kings of the land are required to do. 9 King Solomon asked him, saying: “Is it well with you?” and he said: “It is well.” 10 And he said: “Is it well with Maacah [Tamar’s mother] in your house?” And he said: “It is well.” And then King Solomon cunningly asked: “Is

it well with Tamar, my sister?” And he lied to him, saying: “I do not know, for I have never met her.”

11 And it came to pass when the king of Geshur was in Jerusalem, his friend, Pirshaz, came to Tamar’s room, saying to her: “Lie with me.” 12 But Tamar refused him, saying: “Let us not, my lord; do not do this indecent thing to me, because I am a king’s daughter.” 13 However he would not listen to her, because he was burning with lust. 14 And Tamar knew she was no match for this man, so she cunningly said: “My lord, listen to the words of your maidservant. 15 Behold, I play the harp beautifully. First, lie down at my knees and listen to my song. 16 And after I play the song of my heart, then I will do all your heart’s desire.” And Pirshaz listened to Tamar, and he lay in her bosom.

17 And as Tamar took the harp and began to play beautifully, she said in her heart: “LORD, king of my father David, Your servant, 18 send Your light and truth to hold me, and do not allow this wicked, uncircumcised, impure man to have his way with me. 19 For You know what is in my heart, so do not let this daughter of David, Your servant, sin. 20 My Father, my Father, my Father, remember the disgrace of Your servant David, my father, and your daughter’s disgrace. 21 I go before El Shaddai’s throne of glory, and ask mercy for myself, to the God of Hosts to help me by His help. 22 For He does not want wicked men to triumph, and His desire is to help those who have been robbed to overcome the strong. 23 I beseech You, O LORD, save me now. I beseech You, O LORD,

let me prosper. 24 I call on You this day because I am frightened; please answer me, and do not let this impure man cause me to lose holy seed by this impure act, for You are a holy God, and I trust You.”

25 And the LORD heard the voice of David’s daughter, and God caused Pirshaz to fall into a deep sleep. He fell asleep on her bosom while she was playing the relaxing sounds of the harp. 26 And when Tamar saw that he had fallen asleep, she unsheathed the sword that was girded around his waist. 27 And she said: “LORD of Hosts, remember David my father, and sustain me with Your strength like You did my father. 28 Help me as You helped [Jael] the wife of Heber the Kenite, to rid sins and sinners from the earth, so all will know that You are the only LORD.” 29 And she took the sword and ran it through Pirshaz’s heart, and Pirshaz fell to the ground dead.

30 And Tamar saw that Pirshaz was dead and she cried with a loud voice: “May all Your enemies and the enemies of Your people perish this way, O LORD. 31 And now I have seen that You have heard my voice because of my father. You have intervened to not allow his daughter to be disgraced by this impure man. 32 Blessed are You from everlasting to everlasting. Amen.”

33 At the time of the noon meal, Pirshaz’s servants came to call their master to the king’s table. 34 When they came to the inner chamber, they found Tamar with his bloody sword in her hand standing over the dead body of their master Pirshaz. 35 And they turned trembling to one

another, saying: “What happened?” And they took Tamar into custody and brought her to the king’s ministers. 36 And the king’s servants said to Tamar: “What have you done? You have killed the king’s friend. You know that our master, the king will consider this a disgrace.” 37 And Tamar said: “Should one deal with a king’s daughter like a harlot? His blood is upon his own head, and I will be seen as guiltless and pure in the king’s eyes.” 38 And they took Tamar and put her in the hands of the warden of the prison.

39 And they sent a letter to their king who was still in Jerusalem, by the hands of the couriers, that Tamar, the king’s granddaughter had killed his friend, Pirshaz, and that Tamar was sent to prison until the time the king returned.

40 And the couriers came to Jerusalem and King Solomon’s guards stopped them. And he asked them: “Where are you from?” 41 And they said: “We come from Geshur to bring letters to our master the king.” 42 And the guards seized them and brought them to King Solomon. 43 And King Solomon said: “You came here to spy out the land. Give me your king’s letters and I will see if you are sinning against me or not.” 44 And King Solomon took the letters and gave them to the sons of Shisha, the king’s scribes, to read. 45 And they read through them and found where Tamar had killed Pirshaz and that she was in prison. 46 And King Solomon called Ahishar, who was head of the household, and said: “Put these uncircumcised men in jail, and bring the king of Geshur to me.” 47 And he

did exactly as he had been commanded. And the king of Geshur was brought before King Solomon and he bowed his head toward the ground. 48 And King Solomon said: “Why have you deceived me, lying, while Tamar my sister was with you? You told me that you had never met her in your entire life. 49 As the LORD lives, who has redeemed David, my father, out of all evil, this very day you will die.” 50 And King Solomon called Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and said to him: “Go, and execute the king of Geshur and his couriers.” And he executed them, and they all died, because they had lied to King Solomon. 51 And they buried them in a cave right before the Fish Gate. 52 This is why the name of the cave right before the Fish Gate is the called Cave of the Uncircumcised Ones, unto this day.

53 And Solomon sent Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and ten thousand valiant men of Judah with him, and he said to them: 54 “Go to Geshur and bring back Tamar, my father’s daughter, with you, and destroy the royal palace, but be careful not to harm Tamar’s mother, for she was King David’s wife.” 55 And they went and did all that King Solomon had commanded, and they brought Tamar before King Solomon.

56 And Tamar bowed down to the ground, before the king, and said: “Let my lord the king, my brother, live forever.” 57 And King Solomon asked her: “Why did you flee to Geshur?” 58 And she answered: “I was living in my brother Absalom’s home, disgraced because of what my brother Amnon had done to me, and I decided to go to my

mother’s house so I would not be disgraced in the eyes of the princes there. 59 And King Solomon asked her: “Why did you kill Pirshaz?” And she answered: “This is what that uncircumcised one did to me, and this is what I did to him in revenge.” 60 And King Solomon said: “The LORD has truly blessed you with discretion. You were wise, and acted, and you were victorious.”

61 Then King Solomon spoke openly to all of his servants, saying: “Has anyone found such a charming and heroic woman?” And he said: “Daughter, God is gracious unto you. 62 From this day forward you shall not be called my sister, but my daughter, because you were extremely wise.” 63 And King Solomon gave his daughter Tamar to Abinadab’s son to be his wife, and she found grace in her husband’s eyes, and he loved her very much. 64 He was an officer over all the region of Dor. 65 And King Solomon renamed Tamar his daughter Taphath, for stacte, the first of the incense, and this was her name the rest of her life.

14. The Great Tribulation

1 And it came to pass on the first day of the seventh month, at New Year’s, in the four hundred and seventyeighth year after the children of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the second year of King Solomon’s reign over Israel, I had a vision from the LORD, when I was upon the Gihon spring. 2 And I raised my eyes, and lo, the heavens rolled back like a scroll, and I saw the glory of the LORD, sitting on an extremely high throne. 3 And here is the appearance of the throne: twelve stairs led up to the throne (six of gold and six of silver), and there was a square back to the throne, like a sapphire stone. 4 And at its right side were three chairs and at its left side were four chairs near the throne, like the seven that see the king’s face, covered with gold and silver and precious stones. 5 And the glory of the LORD had the appearance like that of the rainbow, His covenant. 6 And the host of heaven were standing before Him on His right hand and on His left, and Satan was standing by them, but behind them.

7 And then a man dressed in linen brought before the glory of the LORD three books that contained the records of every man. 8 And he read the first book and it contained the just deeds of His people, and the LORD said, “These are granted eternal life.” 9 And Satan said, “Who are these

guilty people?” And the man dressed in linen cried to Satan like a ram’s horn saying, “Silence! This day is holy to our Lord.” 10 And he read the second book, and it contained the unintentional sins of His people, and the LORD said, “Put that book aside, but save it, until one third of the month passes by, to see what they will do.” 11 And he read the third book, and it contained the wicked deeds of His people. 12 And the LORD said to Satan, “These are your share. Take them and do what you want with them.” 13 And Satan took the wicked to a waste land to destroy them there.

14 And the man dressed in linen cried like a ram’s horn, saying: 15 “Blessed are the people who know the joyful shout, O LORD, who walk in the light of Your countenance.”

16 And I heard the voice of the host of heaven rejoicing and saying, “Master of Justice, the LORD of hosts, the whole heaven and earth is full of Your glory.”

17 And I was shocked by the vision since I did not know what the LORD had done for me. 18 Then one of the cherubs flew up to me and he put an olive leaf on my mouth, and said, “Lo, this has touched your mouth, and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven. 19 And this law that you have seen is a statute for Israel, and a law to the God of Abraham, and peace unto Isaac your father. 20 And the LORD will bless your people in the trial with everlasting peace.” 21 And I said, “Amen. May the

LORD our God do this for us forever and ever.” 22 And the angel answered, “Amen and Amen.”
